“Lead pipe colon” = a long, smooth, featureless colon from **loss of haustra**, usually due to **chronic inflammation with fibrosis and muscular atrophy** (classically described on barium enema, but you can infer the same idea on CT when the colon is persistently featureless).
## Common causes
1. **Chronic ulcerative colitis (classic, exam favourite)**
	- Continuous disease, typically **starts at the rectum** and extends proximally
	- Chronic phase: **loss of haustration**, **shortened colon**, possible pseudopolyps

2. **Chronic radiation colitis**
	- Fixed, smooth, often **segmental** involvement in the **radiation field** (classically rectosigmoid after pelvic RT)
	- May see associated stricturing, adjacent pelvic/radiation changes

3. **Cathartic colon (long-term stimulant laxative use)**
	- Can cause **colonic atony** with reduced/absent haustration (often described in transverse/descending colon)
	- Diagnosis leans heavily on the history (imaging alone is not “slam dunk”)
