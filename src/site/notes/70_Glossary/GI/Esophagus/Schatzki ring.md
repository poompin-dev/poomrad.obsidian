## Core idea
  - **A pathologically tight [[70_Glossary/GI/Esophagus/B ring\|B ring]]**
  - Almost always associated with **hiatus hernia**
## Imaging (barium swallow)
  - Thin, concentric, smooth **web-like narrowing** at distal oesophagus
  - Located at **[[70_Glossary/GI/Esophagus/A ring\|A ring]]/B ring region** → Schatzki = **B mucosal ring**
  - Often best seen in **prone oblique** or with **full-column** technique
## Clinical
  - Intermittent **solid food dysphagia**, “steakhouse syndrome”
  - Many asymptomatic; symptoms when lumen ≤ ~13 mm (don’t quote number in viva unless asked)
## Differentials
  - Peptic stricture: **longer, irregular**, tapered
  - Oesophageal web: **proximal, anterior**, not at GOJ
  - Carcinoma: **irregular, shouldered**, mucosal destruction
## Exam nuggets
  - Association with **GERD/hiatus hernia**
  - Treatment: **endoscopic dilatation**, PPI for reflux control
