> [!TLDR] TLDR
> An achalasia-like picture caused by something blocking or infiltrating the GOJ, usually a tumour, not [[achalasia\|primary nerve plexus failure]]. Most often due to distal oesophageal or gastric cardia carcinoma, and should be suspected in an older patient with rapid onset dysphagia and marked weight loss.

## Definition
- Syndrome with **dysphagia + manometry that looks like [[achalasia\|achalasia]]** (impaired LES relaxation, absent peristalsis)
- But due to **secondary cause**, most commonly **malignancy at distal oesophagus / gastric cardia**.
## Typical causes
- **Adenocarcinoma** at GOJ/cardia (big one for exams)
- Other: extrinsic compression (mass, lymph nodes), post-surgical (tight fundoplication), occasionally other infiltrative diseases.

## VS primary achalasia
### Clinical
- **Age**: usually **older** onset.
- **Course**: more **rapid progression** of dysphagia, prominent **weight loss**.
- **Endoscopy**: mural thickening, mass at GOJ
### Imaging
**Barium**: can still show a **tapering distal oesophagus**, but often **shorter, more irregular, shouldered** → “[[70_Glossary/GI/Esophagus/Rat-tail sign\|rat-tail sign]]”, suspicious for malignancy.
**CT:** mural thickening, mass at GOJ, nodes, adjacent invasion
