- Cartilage cap (especially on MRI)
## Other types of exostoses
- **Subungual exostosis**: beneath toenail/fingernail, often reactive
- **Traumatic exostosis**: e.g. surfer’s ear (external auditory canal)
- **Turret exostosis**: post-traumatic bone spur
- **Reactive exostosis**: at insertion sites (chronic traction)
