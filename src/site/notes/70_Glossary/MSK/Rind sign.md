> [!summary] Definition
> Thick, relatively uniform **sclerotic shell** of reactive bone surrounding a **medullary lesion**, classically seen in **monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the proximal femur**.

## Key imaging points
- **Modality**: best appreciated on **plain radiograph**, also visible on CT as dense cortical-like rim.
- **Appearance**:
	- Well-defined **intramedullary** lucent / ground-glass lesion.
	- **Markedly thick sclerotic border** (“rind”) – much thicker than the usual thin benign sclerotic margin.
	- Often **metaphyseal/diaphyseal** in long bones, especially **proximal femur**.
- **Associated changes** (if fibrous dysplasia):
	- Mild expansion, cortical thinning.
	- Possible deformity (e.g. **[[shepherd’s crook\|shepherd’s crook]]**).

## Typical association
- **Exam-safe association**:  
	- Rind sign + proximal femur + young patient → **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Fibrous dysplasia\|Fibrous dysplasia]]**.
## Differentials (rind-like lesions)
- **Liposclerosing myxofibrous tumour** – adult, intertrochanteric femur, mixed lytic–sclerotic, irregular thick rim.
- **Healed/simple bone cyst or other fibro-osseous lesion** – can have a prominent rim but usually less “classic”.
- **Bone infarct** – tends to have **serpiginous central sclerosis**, not a smooth, circumferential rind.
