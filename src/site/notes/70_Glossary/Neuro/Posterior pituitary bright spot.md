Normal MRI finding representing the **neurohypophysis**.

On **non-contrast T1-weighted images**, the posterior pituitary appears as a **small, midline, T1-hyperintense dot** at the back of the sella. The high signal is thought to relate to **vasopressin-containing neurosecretory granules** and their lipid/protein content.

Typical appearance:
- **Sagittal T1**: bright focus at the posterior floor of the sella.
- **Coronal T1**: bright dot at the posterior margin of the gland.

Clinical significance:
- Usually **preserved (or displaced)** in **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Pituitary adenoma\|pituitary adenoma]]** → diabetes insipidus (DI) at presentation is uncommon.
- **Absent or ectopic** bright spot suggests **central DI** or **stalk pathology**, e.g.:
  - [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Hypophysitis\|Hypophysitis]]
  - Langerhans cell histiocytosis
  - Metastasis / post-surgical / post-radiation damage
  - Stalk interruption syndrome
	  - Ectopic bright spot at median eminence
	  - Thin/absent stalk
	  - Small anterior gland).

Exam line: *“Loss or ectopic posterior bright spot = think central DI / stalk disease.*
