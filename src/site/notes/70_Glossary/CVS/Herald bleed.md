a small, self-limiting haemorrhage that **warns** you a **massive, often fatal bleed is coming soon**.

Classic exam association
- **Aortoenteric fistula** (primary or more often _secondary_ after AAA repair):
    - Patient with aortic graft + a bit of **melaena or haematemesis** that then settles = **herald bleed**
    - Hours–days later → **massive GI bleed**.
