> Generalised blue–purple, non-blanching papules/nodules in a neonate due to dermal extramedullary haematopoiesis (or less commonly, skin metastases).

In rad exams it’s a clinical clue to underlying systemic disease that must be further investigated with imaging.

## Main aetiologic groups
### 1. Congenital infections (TORCH & friends)
Mechanism: marrow suppression / haemolysis → extramedullary haematopoiesis
- Classically: **congenital rubella**.
- Also: CMV, toxoplasmosis, parvovirus B19, syphilis, others.
### 2. Haematologic / malignant
Mechanism: extensive bone marrow infiltration/replacement → extramedullary haematopoiesis ± direct skin infiltration
- **Congenital leukaemia** (esp. myelomonocytic).
- **Langerhans cell histiocytosis** (disseminated / Letterer–Siwe type).
- Occasionally other [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Soft tissue tumor/Sarcoma/Small round blue cell tumours\|small round blue cell tumours]], e.g. **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Neuroblastoma\|neuroblastoma]]** with skin metastases.
### 3. Severe haemolytic / hypoxic states
Mechanism: severe chronic anaemia/hypoxia → marked extramedullary haematopoiesis (liver, spleen, skin).
- Haemolytic disease of the newborn (Rh/ABO).
- Twin–twin transfusion
- Severe intrauterine hypoxia, e.g. massive feto-maternal haemorrhage.
