> Anti-resorptive drugs that **suppress osteoclasts**, improve BMD, but predispose to **low-turnover bone complications**, especially **atypical femoral fracture** and **osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)**.

## Typical clinical context
- Long-term therapy for:
	- Primary / secondary **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteoporosis/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]]**
	- **Metastatic bone disease** (IV forms: zoledronate, pamidronate)
- Red flag: **>3–5 years** continuous use + new bone pain (thigh, groin, jaw).
## Complications
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Special fracture/Atypical femoral fracture\|Atypical femoral fracture]]
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Head and neck/Teeth/Osteonecrosis of the jaw\|Osteonecrosis of the jaw]]
## Other radiology points
- **Metaphyseal sclerotic bands** in growing children on cyclical IV therapy  
  (“zebra stripe lines” – dense metaphyseal lines parallel to physes).
- Long-term therapy may make bone look **diffusely sclerotic** and “strong”,  
  but **mechanically brittle** → don’t be reassured by BMD alone.
