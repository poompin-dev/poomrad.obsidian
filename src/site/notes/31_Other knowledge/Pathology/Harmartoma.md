## Overview
A **hamartoma** is a benign growth composed of an **abnormal mixture** of cells and tissues that are **normally found** in the area of the body where the hamartoma occurs. 

Unlike other types of tumor, which grow uncontrollably, hamartomas are generally **well-differentiated** and **grow at the same rate** as the surrounding tissues.
## Key characteristics 
1. **Disorganized growth**
2. **Benign nature**

Most hamartomas are found incidentally and do not require treatment unless they cause symptoms or complications.
