Orderly **anterograde** breakdown of an axon → myelin distal to a focal injury that interrupts axonal transport. 

## Sequelae
**PNS**: Schwann cells proliferate → form guiding tubes and secrete growth factors → axons regenerate along their original path. 

**CNS:**  Inhibitory myelin proteins and astrocytic glial scar prevent meaningful regrowth → tract atrophy and gliosis → appears as T2 hyperintensity and chronic volume loss along affected tracts on MRI.
