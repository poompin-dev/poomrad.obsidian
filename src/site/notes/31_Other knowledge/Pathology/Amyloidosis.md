## Definition & core concept

- **Amyloid** = pathologic, extracellular, proteinaceous material composed of **non-branching fibrils (7–10 nm)** with **β-pleated sheet** configuration.
- **Amyloidosis** = group of diseases due to **amyloid deposition** in one or multiple organs.
- Key shared features:
  - **Congo red positive** with **apple-green birefringence** under polarised light.
  - **Extracellular, amorphous, eosinophilic** deposits on H&E (“waxy”, “hyaline”).
  - Binds **serum amyloid P component** and glycosaminoglycans, which stabilise fibrils.

## Classification

### By biochemical type (exam-core)

- **AL (light chain)**  
  - Protein: Ig light chains (κ, λ).  
  - Source: plasma cell dyscrasia.  
  - Organs: kidney, heart, peripheral/autonomic nerves, liver, GI, soft tissue (macroglossia).

- **AA (amyloid-associated)**  
  - Protein: serum amyloid A (acute-phase reactant).  
  - Setting: chronic inflammatory disease (RA, IBD, TB, bronchiectasis, etc.).  
  - Organs: kidney (dominant), liver, spleen, adrenals, GI.

- **ATTR (transthyretin)**  
  - Protein: transthyretin (TTR, prealbumin), normal or mutant.  
  - Hereditary: neuropathy ± cardiomyopathy.  
  - Wild-type: elderly men, **restrictive cardiomyopathy** (senile systemic).

- **Aβ**  
  - From APP (amyloid precursor protein).  
  - Alzheimer disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

- **Aβ2M (β2-microglobulin)**  
  - Long-term haemodialysis.  
  - Joints, bones, tendons (carpal tunnel, destructive arthropathy).
### By distribution (clinical)

- **Systemic amyloidosis**
  - **AL (primary)**: immunoglobulin light chains from clonal plasma cells (e.g. multiple myeloma, MGUS).
  - **AA (secondary)**: from serum amyloid A (SAA) in chronic inflammation/infection.
  - **Hereditary ATTR**: mutant transthyretin (TTR), autosomal dominant.
  - **Wild-type ATTR (senile systemic)**: non-mutated TTR, mainly elderly, cardiac.
  - **Dialysis-related**: β2-microglobulin deposition, especially in bone/joints.

- **Localised amyloidosis**
  - **Aβ** in Alzheimer disease (brain, cerebral vessels).
  - **Islet amyloid (amylin)** in type 2 diabetes (pancreatic islets).
  - Local deposits in **endocrine tumours**, respiratory/GU tract, skin, etc.

## Pathogenesis

1. **Overproduction / reduced clearance / structural abnormality** of a precursor protein → prone to misfolding.
2. **Misfolding → β-pleated sheet** structure → self-assembly into fibrils.
3. Fibrils accumulate extracellularly, stabilised by **serum amyloid P** and matrix components.
4. Tissue damage via:
	- Physical distortion of architecture.
	- Interference with cell–matrix interactions, capillary perfusion, etc.

---
## Pathology & diagnosis

### Light microscopy

- H&E: **amorphous, eosinophilic, hyaline** deposits in vessel walls, basement membranes, interstitium.
- Organ-specific patterns:
	- Kidney: glomerular mesangium, capillary walls, arterioles, interstitium.
	- Heart: interstitial, perimyocytic deposits → “rubbery” myocardium.
	- Liver: space of Disse, vascular walls.
### Special stains
- **Congo red**: salmon-pink deposits in transmitted light, **apple-green birefringence** under polarised light (gold-standard description).
- May also be positive with other amyloid-specific dyes (e.g. Thioflavin  T) but less exam-relevant.
### Electron microscopy
- Non-branching fibrils, ~7–10 nm diameter, randomly arranged or in bundles.
### Amyloid typing
- Essential for management (AL vs ATTR vs AA).
- Methods:
	- Immunohistochemistry / immunofluorescence.
	- Laser microdissection + mass spectrometry (increasingly reference standard).
	- Correlation with serum/urine light chains, genetic testing (TTR mutations).
---
## Major clinical patterns

### 1. Renal amyloidosis
- **Most common organ involvement** in systemic AL and AA.
- Clinical:
	- **Nephrotic syndrome**: heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema.
	- Progressive CKD; bland urine sediment (often few cells).
- Pathology:
	- Glomerular + vascular amyloid deposits.
- Imaging:
	- **US**: normal or **enlarged kidneys** with increased cortical echogenicity early; small and shrunken in late-stage CKD.
	- **CT**: smooth hepatomegaly / nephromegaly pattern in multisystem disease.

### 2. Cardiac amyloidosis
- Common in **AL** and **ATTR** (hereditary + wild-type).
- Clinical:
	- **Restrictive cardiomyopathy** (HFpEF), diastolic failure.
	- Low-voltage ECG (volume-voltage mismatch), conduction disease, arrhythmias.
- Imaging:
	- **Echo**:
		- Concentric thickening of LV walls (looks like hypertrophy but due to infiltration).
		- Speckled/granular myocardium (non-specific).
		- Bi-atrial enlargement, diastolic dysfunction.
	- **Cardiac MRI**:
		- **Elevated native T1, expanded ECV**.
		- **Difficulty nulling myocardium** on inversion recovery.
		- **Diffuse subendocardial or transmural LGE.**
	- **Nuclear (bone tracers, e.g. 99mTc-DPD / PYP)**:
		- Strong myocardial uptake in **ATTR** (Perugini grade 2–3), less in AL → key non-biopsy diagnostic pathway → supports ATTR if no monoclonal gammopathy.

> [!tip]
> Older patient with heart failure, **increased wall thickness + low-voltage ECG + positive bone-tracer cardiac scan** → think **ATTR cardiac amyloidosis**, not hypertensive LVH.

### 3. Peripheral & autonomic neuropathy
- AL and hereditary ATTR.
- Symmetrical sensorimotor neuropathy, autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension, GI dysmotility, impotence).
- MSK/nerve-related manifestations:
	- **Carpal tunnel syndrome** (median nerve compression).
	- “Shoulder–pad” sign from periarticular soft-tissue deposits (classically AL).

### 4. Liver & spleen involvement
- Clinical:
	- Hepatomegaly ± cholestatic LFTs.
	- Splenomegaly; rarely functional asplenia/hypersplenism.
- Pathology:
	- “Sago spleen” (white pulp nodular deposits) vs “lardaceous spleen” (diffuse red pulp).
- Imaging:
	- **US/CT/MRI**: enlarged, smooth liver ± splenomegaly; usually non-specific.

### 5. Gastrointestinal involvement
- Oesophagus to rectum, plus mesenteric vessels.
- Features:
	- Malabsorption, weight loss, diarrhoea/constipation.
	- Bleeding (friable mucosa).
- Imaging/endoscopy:
	- Thickened folds, mucosal nodularity, luminal narrowing; but non-specific.

### 6. Bone, joint & soft-tissue amyloid
- **Dialysis-related (β2-microglobulin)**:
	- Long-term haemodialysis patients.
	- Sites: shoulders, wrists, hips, spine.
	- Imaging:
	    - **Radiograph**: cystic bone lesions, periarticular erosions.
	    - **MRI**: low-to-intermediate signal deposits around joints/tendons, carpal tunnel involvement.
- **AL / ATTR**:
	- Tendon and ligament deposits → spontaneous **biceps tendon rupture**, spinal canal stenosis, carpal tunnel.

### 7. CNS & endocrine
- **CNS**: Aβ in Alzheimer disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (lobar haemorrhage risk).
- **Endocrine**:
	- Islet amyloid (amylin) in type 2 diabetes.
	- Amyloid often present in certain endocrine tumours (e.g. medullary thyroid carcinoma).
---
## Investigations
- **Laboratory screening**
	- Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine (UPEP).
	- Serum free light chains (κ/λ ratio).
	- Full renal panel, LFTs, cardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP, troponin).
	- Inflammatory markers (for AA context).
- **Imaging**
	- Organ-specific as above
		  - Echo/CMR; bone-tracer scintigraphy for suspected cardiac ATTR.
- **Biopsy**
	- **Abdominal fat pad aspirate** (minimally invasive).
	- Rectal mucosa, minor salivary gland, or clinically involved organ (kidney, heart, liver).
	- **Congo red + polarised light** to confirm amyloid.
	- Typing by immunohistochemistry / mass spectrometry.

> [!summary]
> Diagnosis requires demonstration of amyloid on tissue biopsy with Congo red staining and subsequent typing (immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry) to distinguish AL, AA, and ATTR.

## Management
- **General principles**
	- Reduce production of precursor protein.
	- Support and monitor organ function (renal, cardiac, hepatic, neurologic).
	- Risk stratification based on extent of cardiac/renal involvement.

- **Type-specific**
	- **AL**: treat underlying plasma cell clone (e.g. bortezomib-based chemotherapy, ± stem cell transplant); aggressive cardiac disease = poor prognosis.
	- **AA**: control underlying inflammatory/infectious disease (e.g. DMARDs/biologics in RA, treat TB/IBD etc.).
	- **Hereditary/wild-type ATTR**: TTR stabilisers, gene-silencing therapies, ± heart/liver transplant (depending on type).
	- **Dialysis-related**: optimise dialysis (high-flux membranes), consider renal transplant.

> [!warning]
> For systemic amyloidosis, **typing precedes chemo**: never assume “AL” and start myeloma-style treatment without proving a monoclonal process.
