In practice, **myasthenia gravis is mainly an “imaging the thymus” disease**.
## Common
- **Thymic follicular hyperplasia / [[30_Rad Knowledge/Chest/Mediastinum/Thymic rebound\|Thymic hyperplasia]]** (often diffuse, symmetric; can show chemical-shift signal drop)
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Chest/Mediastinum/Thymoma\|Thymoma]]** (anterior mediastinal mass; classic association) 
## Uncommon
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Chest/Mediastinum/Thymolipoma\|Thymolipoma]]**: Fat-containing thymic tumour
## Exam trap
- **Small cell lung cancer** is classically linked to **Lambert-Eaton**, not MG (different NMJ problem, easy to mix up).
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Chest/Mediastinum/Thymic carcinoma\|Thymic carcinoma]]** (MG association is **very rare**, largely case reports; don’t treat it as a typical pairing)
