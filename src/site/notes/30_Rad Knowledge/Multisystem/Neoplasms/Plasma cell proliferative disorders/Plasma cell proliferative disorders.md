## Hallmark:
1. clonal expansion of plasma cells
2. overproduction of **monoclonal (M) protein** or **free light chains (FLCs)** in serum and/or urine
> _Note:_ FLCs include **Bence-Jones proteins** (free κ or λ light chains) and may rarely include heavy chain fragments in rare subtypes.
## Pathophysiology
- clonal proliferation → excess M-protein
- marrow infiltration → cytopenias
- cytokine effects (e.g., IL-6) → osteolysis, anemia
- monoclonal protein deposition → renal, neurologic, or systemic disease

- Primary (AL) amyloidosis
## Clinical Manifestations
- Bone pain, anemia, renal dysfunction, infections, hypercalcemia
- Extramedullary masses ([[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Plasmacytoma\|Plasmacytoma]])
- Organ-specific symptoms in **AL amyloidosis** or **POEMS**
## Etiology
Underlying cause remains unclear. Potential contributing factors:
- Environmental exposures
	- ionizing radiation
	- occupational chemicals (e.g., benzene)
- **Infectious**: chronic viral stimulation
- **Genetic susceptibility**: familial clustering reported
## Diagnostic Workup
- Serum/urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP/UPEP)
- Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE)
- Serum free light chain assay
- Bone marrow biopsy
- **Imaging**
    - Skeletal survey (plain films)
    - Whole-body MRI or FDG PET/CT for early/marrow or extramedullary disease
