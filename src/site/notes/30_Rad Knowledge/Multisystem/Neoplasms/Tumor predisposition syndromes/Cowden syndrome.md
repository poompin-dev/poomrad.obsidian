## Overview
Part of [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/PTEN-related diseases\|PTEN-related diseases]], caused by mutation of *PTEN* gene (AD inheritance with high but variable penetrance).

Also referred to as **PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome (PHTS)** when grouped with related entities.
## Key characteristics
### Mucocutaneous lesions
Present in >90% and often the **earliest** manifestations (clinical hallmark).
- Trichilemmoma
- Mucocutaneous papillomatous papule
- Acral keratoses
- Glycogenic acanthosis
- Oral papillomas (tongue, gingiva)
### Neurological
- Macrocephaly
- Intellectual disability

**[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/CNS Neoplasm/Dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma\|Lhermitte-Duclos disease]] (adult-onset dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma)** is a major criterion
### Harmatoma
- Thyroid
	- Adenoma
	- Multi-nodular goiters
- GI [[31_Other knowledge/Pathology/Harmartoma\|harmartomatous]] polyps (small and large bowel)
- Breast: benign breast disease (fibrocystic change, fibroadenomas)
- Uterine fibroid
- Lipoma
	- Testicular lipomatosis
- Fibromas
### Malignancies
- Breast cancer: ~30-50%
- Thyroid cancer: **↑ risk** of thyroid carcinoma (often follicular)
- Endometrial cancer: ~5-10%
- CNS: Dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma ([[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/CNS Neoplasm/Dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma\|Lhermitte-Duclos disease]])
