Deletion 11p13 involving **WT1 + PAX6**.
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Renal masses/Wilms tumour\|Wilms tumour]]: ↑ risk, often bilateral; background [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Renal masses/Nephroblastomatosis\|nephrogenic rest]].
- Aniridia: due to PAX6 involvement.
- Genitourinary anomalies: gonadal dysgenesis, cryptorchidism, ambiguous genitalia, other GU malformations.
- Intellectual disability / developmental delay *(historically “mental retardation”)*

Considered a **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/Tumour predisposition syndrome\|tumour predisposition syndrome]]** because of high Wilms risk.

Screening implication: high-risk child → periodic renal US in early childhood to detect Wilms early.
