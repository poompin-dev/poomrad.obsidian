> [!summary]
> Usually **benign Schwann-cell tumour** composed of granular eosinophilic cells; can occur almost anywhere but classically **tongue/head & neck**, also **breast**, **skin/subcutis**, **GI**, **tracheobronchial/larynx**. Imaging pitfall = **mimics malignancy**.

A typically benign peripheral nerve sheath tumour that often looks **more aggressive than it is** on imaging.
___
## Imaging features
### Breast
Often assessed as BI-RADS 5; contributes to 5% false-positive rate
- **Mammogram:** 
	- Irregular or **spiculated** solitary mass ± architectural distortion.
	- Usually lack calcifications.
	- More frequent in upper inner breast, near chest wall.
- **US:** hypoechoic, irregular/ill-defined, posterior shadowing; may be taller-than-wide → can look like carcinoma.
- **MRI:** variable enhancement (often irregular); not reliably benign-appearing.
- Tip: may be superficial/within dermis–subcutis or along **Cooper ligaments**; can tether skin.
#### Differentials
- **Breast carcinoma** (main mimic): imaging overlaps → **tissue diagnosis** needed.
- **Fat necrosis / radial scar** (spiculated distortion): correlate with history; still often needs biopsy.
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Soft tissue tumor/Intermediate/Fibromatosis\|Fibromatosis]] / scar** (shadowing mass).
### Head & neck
- Often small submucosal nodule; imaging non-specific.
- Can be **multifocal** in aerodigestive tract (rare).
### Airway
- Endobronchial polypoid lesion → focal obstruction/atelectasis/post-obstructive change.
- Ddx with: **Papilloma / carcinoid** tumours
___
## Trivia
- Origin: **Schwann cell**, typically **S-100 positive** (path factoid).
- Common site: **tongue**; breast GCT is a classic “benign-but-spiculated” trap.
- **Malignant transformation is rare** but recognised (think: rapid growth, size increase, invasion/metastasis).
- Slight **female** predominance with predilection for **Black** population.
- Not to be confused with [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Granular cell tumour of the pituitary region\|granular cell tumour of the pituitary region]].
