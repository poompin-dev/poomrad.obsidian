> [!summary] Key Concept
> 
> A benign neural sheath tumour (Schwann cell origin) that is a major "malignancy mimic" on imaging.
> 
> - **Classic location:** Tongue (most common).
>     
> - **Classic Trap:** Breast mass that looks essentially identical to invasive carcinoma (spiculated, shadowing).
>     
> - **Key Path:** S-100 positive, **PAS-positive**.
>     

## Clinical Context
- **Demographics:** Adults (30–50s), F > M (2:1), predilection for **Black** populations.    
- **Presentation:** Painless, firm, slow-growing nodule.
- **Sites:**
    - **Head & Neck:** >50% (Tongue is #1).
    - **Breast:** ~5–8% (often mimics CA).
    - **MSK:** Subcutaneous tissues, often follows superficial nerves.
- **Prognosis:** usually benign (<2% malignant), but **locally infiltrative** $\rightarrow$ high recurrence rate if not widely excised.

## Imaging Features

### 1. Breast (The Great Mimicker)
_Often misdiagnosed as BI-RADS 4C/5._
- **Mammogram:**
    - High-density, irregular mass.
    - **Spiculated** margins (infiltrative growth).
    - Does **NOT** typically calcify (unlike many carcinomas).
    - _Location:_ Often **superficial** / subcutaneous (supraclavicular nerve territory) or upper inner quadrant.
- **Ultrasound:**
    - Hypoechoic, irregular, **posterior acoustic shadowing**.
    - Halo of hyperechogenicity (desmoplastic reaction).
    - _Taller-than-wide_ orientation is common.
- **MRI:**
    - **Morphology:** Spiculated/irregular.
    - **Kinetics:** Type II (plateau) or Type III (washout) curves $\rightarrow$ overlaps with malignancy.

### 2. MSK / Soft Tissue (Head & Neck)
- **CT:**
    - Isoattenuating to muscle.
    - Enhances moderately (can be homogeneous or heterogeneous).
- **MRI (High Yield):**
    - **T1:** Isointense to muscle.
    - **T2:** **Hypointense** or isointense to muscle (due to granular cytoplasm/high cellularity).
        - _Note:_ Most soft tissue tumours are T2 bright. If it's **T2 dark/iso**, think: Granular cell tumour, Fibromatosis, Giant Cell Tumour of Tendon Sheath (GCTTS), or clear cell sarcoma.
    - **Peripheral Rim:** May show a hyperintense rim on T2 (capsule/pseudocapsule).
    - **Enhancement:** Homogeneous avid enhancement.

## Pathology & Management
### Histology
- **Origin:** Schwann cells of peripheral nerves.
- **Microscopy:** Large polygonal cells with **granular eosinophilic cytoplasm**.
- **Stains:**
    - **S-100:** Positive (neural origin).
    - **PAS:** Positive (diastase-resistant granules)—_classic exam discriminator_.
    - **CD68:** Positive (lysosomes).
### Management
- **Biopsy is essential:** Imaging cannot differentiate from carcinoma.
- **Surgery:** **Wide Local Excision (WLE)**.
    - _Why?_ Margins are infiltrative. Simple enucleation leads to a 20–30% recurrence rate.

## Differential Diagnosis

> [!tip] Differential Strategy
> 
> If in the Breast: It mimics Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC).
> 
> If in the Tongue: It mimics Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC).

1. **Invasive Breast Carcinoma:** Indistinguishable on imaging; Ca++ makes carcinoma more likely.
2. **Fat Necrosis:** Usually history of trauma; MRI T1 fat signal helps.
3. **Desmoid Type Fibromatosis:** Also T2 dark/iso and infiltrative, but usually chest wall/muscular origin rather than intraparenchymal breast.
4. **Schwannoma:** Usually T2 bright, well-circumscribed (not spiculated).
