A heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies (B-cell >> T/NK) that presents as **nodal and/or extranodal** disease; imaging pattern reflects **aggressive vs indolent** biology.
## Big buckets
- **Aggressive (high-grade)**: rapidly enlarging, bulky masses; may have necrosis (esp. very high-grade or post-treatment).
	- Examples: [[DLBCL\|DLBCL]], [[Burkitt lymphoma\|Burkitt lymphoma]], [[Lymphoblastic lymphoma\|Lymphoblastic lymphoma]], [[ALCL\|ALCL]]
- **Indolent (low-grade)**: long-standing lymphadenopathy, organomegaly; transformation can occur.
	- Examples: [[Follicular lymphoma\|Follicular lymphoma]], [[Marginal zone lymphoma\|Marginal zone lymphoma]], [[Mantle cell lymphoma\|Mantle cell lymphoma]] (often behaves more aggressively)

## Imaging patterns
### Nodes
- Enlarged, usually **homogeneous soft tissue**; can be bulky/confluent.
- Tends to **encase vessels/structures** rather than invade early (helpful vs many carcinomas).
### Extranodal
Common and high-yield sites
- **GI**: segmental wall thickening/mass; small bowel may show “aneurysmal” dilatation; perforation risk (esp. after treatment).
- **Spleen/liver**: diffuse enlargement ± focal lesions.
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal masses/Renal lymphoma\|Kidney]]**: multiple bilateral hypoenhancing masses or diffuse infiltration; often with retroperitoneal nodes.
- **Bone marrow**: focal/diffuse infiltration (MRI/DWI helpful).
- **CNS/Testis**: sanctuary sites → consider in relapse patterns.
### PET-CT
- Key for staging + response in **FDG-avid** NHL (many are, but avidity varies by subtype/grade).
- Residual mass ≠ active disease → metabolic assessment helps.

> [!notice] Reminder
 “NHL” isn’t one disease: **subtype/grade changes imaging behaviour and management**.
