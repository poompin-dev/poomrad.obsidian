Malignant lymphoid neoplasm that most often presents as **nodal disease** ([[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Hodgkin Lymphoma\|HL]] and low-grade NHL), whereas high-grade [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\|NHL]] can present with complication from mass effects such as [[SVC obstruction\|SVC obstruction]]. **Extranodal involvement** is common and can mimic infection/inflammation/metastases in many organs.

> [!summary]
> Think **bulky, relatively homogeneous soft-tissue**, often **multifocal**, with a tendency to **encase** rather than destroy/obstruct early.

___
## Imaging features
### CT
- **Lymph nodes**: enlarged, usually **homogeneous**; may **coalesce** into bulky masses.
- **Vascular encasement without occlusion** is a classic vibe (e.g., mesenteric “sandwich” pattern).
- **Necrosis/cystic change**: more in aggressive subtypes or post-treatment; also raises infection/TB in ddx.
- **Spleen/liver**: diffuse enlargement or focal low-attenuation lesions.
### FDG PET-CT 
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Lugano staging (2014)\|Lugano staging]]: Best for mapping extent and treatment response
- **Deauville scoring** for metabolic response criteria
### MRI
- Marrow, CNS, liver/spleen, pelvis: **DWI restriction** is common (high cellularity).
## Common differentials
- TB/sarcoid/reactive nodes
- Metastatic disease
- IgG4-related disease.
___
## Specific entities
- [[Primary CNS lymphoma\|Primary CNS lymphoma]]: deep/periventricular enhancing mass, marked diffusion restriction; **avoid steroids before biopsy** if possible (can melt the lesion).
- [[Lymphoma of bone\|Primary bone lymphoma]]: permeative/moth-eaten lesion ± large soft-tissue component, sometimes surprisingly little cortical destruction.
- [[Small bowel lymphoma\|Small bowel lymphoma]]: segmental bulky wall thickening, **aneurysmal dilatation**, less desmoplastic obstruction than adenocarcinoma; perforation can occur.
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal masses/Renal lymphoma\|Renal lymphoma]]: multiple renal masses or diffuse infiltration; can mimic pyelonephritis/metastases.
- [[Testicular lymphoma\|Testicular lymphoma]]: older patient, bilateral tendency; crucial because relapse/CNS risk differs.
___
## Lymphomatogenic risk factors
- Viral infection: EBV, HTLV-1, HIV, HCV, HSV, HHV-8
- Bacterial infection: *H.pylori*
- Post-transplantation
