A B-cell [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Lymphoma\|Lymphoma]] with **orderly, contiguous nodal spread** (more predictable than [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\|NHL]]), classically **cervical/mediastinal**. Extranodal disease is less common and usually late.

> [!summary]
> HL = “**nodal first, stepwise spread**” + **bulky mediastinum** is a classic exam set-up.

## Trivia
- Bimodal age distribution (young adults and older adults); male predominance in some subtypes.
- “B symptoms”: fever, night sweats, weight loss (prognostic/staging relevance). → generally associated with **higher tumour burden/more advanced biology** and a **worse prognosis**
- Characteristic "Reed-Sternberg cell" in histopathology.
___
## Imaging features
### CT
- **Lymphadenopathy**: often **bulky, homogeneous**, can be conglomerate.
- Typical distribution:
	- **Cervical/supraclavicular** + **mediastinal** (very common).
	- Then para-aortic/iliac with progression (contiguous pattern).
- **Splenic involvement** can occur; liver less common early.
- Necrosis/cavitation is not typical untreated → consider infection or aggressive NHL if prominent.
### FDG PET-CT
- Most HL is **strongly FDG-avid** → preferred for [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Lugano staging (2014)\|staging]] and response assessment.
- Residual mass after treatment is common (fibrosis) → PET helps distinguish active vs scar.
### MRI
- Problem-solving for marrow/CNS or when reducing radiation matters (esp. younger patients).
___
## Differentials
- **TB/sarcoid/reactive nodes**: distribution + clinical + necrosis/calcification patterns may help.
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\|NHL]]**: more often non-contiguous spread, extranodal dominant disease, necrosis in high-grade.
- Post-therapy: don’t call “residual mass = recurrence” without metabolic/serial correlation.
