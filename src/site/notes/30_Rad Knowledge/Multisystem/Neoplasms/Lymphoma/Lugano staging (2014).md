Modern [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Lymphoma\|lymphoma]] staging that **keeps [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Ann Arbor staging\|Ann Arbor anatomic stages]]** but formally integrates **FDG PET-CT** for FDG-avid lymphomas and standardises terminology.

## Key updates
- **PET-CT is incorporated into standard staging** for **FDG-avid** lymphomas; **CT** is used for non-/variably FDG-avid histologies.
- Ann Arbor-style anatomic description still used, but **A/B suffix is kept only for [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Hodgkin Lymphoma\|HL]]**.
- “**X bulky**” is **not necessary** in Lugano; instead **report the largest tumour diameter** (and describe mass effect/complications).
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: if PET-CT is done, it’s **not routinely indicated for HL**, and often can be avoided in **most DLBCL**.
## Practical grouping
Many protocols simplify to 
- **limited** (I–II non-bulky)
- **Advanced** (III–IV)
- Stage II bulky may be handled variably depending on histology/prognostic factors.
## “E” suffix nuances
- Lugano still uses E suffix for **limited extra-nodal disease** e.g. **IE** and **IIE**.
- **E does not apply to stage III** nodal disease as it is not relevant to patients with advanced-stage disease.
