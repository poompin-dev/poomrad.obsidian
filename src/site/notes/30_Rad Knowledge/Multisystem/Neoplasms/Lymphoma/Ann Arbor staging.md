Anatomic staging system for lymphoma based on **nodal distribution vs extranodal spread**; originally designed for [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Hodgkin Lymphoma\|HL]] and many [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\|NHL]].

## Stages
- **Stage I**
	- Single lymphatic site (nodal region / Waldeyer ring / thymus / spleen), **or** 
	- Single extranodal site without nodal disease (**IE**).
- **Stage II**
	- ≥2 nodal regions on the **same side** of diaphragm, **or** 
	- Contiguous extra-lymphatic extension from a nodal site with or without involvement of other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (**IIE**).
- **Stage III**
	- Nodal disease on **both sides** of diaphragm; 
	- may include contiguous extranodal extension (**IIIE**) and/or spleen (**IIIS**).
- **Stage IV**
	Diffuse/disseminated extranodal organ involvement (e.g., liver, marrow, non-contiguous lung, CSF), with or without nodal disease.

## Suffixes / modifiers
- **A/B**: absence/presence of “B symptoms”.
- **E**: single extranodal site that is contiguous/proximal to nodal disease (or isolated extranodal = IE).
- **S**: splenic involvement. 
- **X (bulky)**: introduced in **Cotswolds modification**; size definition varies by protocol (7-15 cm or >1/3 thoracic diameter).
