Visual score comparing residual FDG uptake in [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Lymphoma\|lymphoma]] sites to two reference tissues: mediastinal blood pool and liver.

## Reference regions
- **Mediastinum:** blood pool (typically ascending aorta)
- **Liver:** usually right lobe (avoid focal lesions)
## Scores (DS 1-5)
1. No uptake above background.
2. Uptake ≤ mediastinum.
3. Uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver.
4. Uptake moderately > liver (diffusely or focally at sites of disease).
5. Uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new FDG-avid lesions typical for lymphoma.

> Common exam-safe shorthand: 
> - DS 1-3 usually = complete metabolic response (CMR)
> - DS 4-5 = residual active disease.

> Caveat: “positive/negative” cut depends on context (interim vs end-of-treatment, histology, trial protocol).
## Pitfalls and traps
- Inflammation/infection, post-biopsy, radiotherapy change.
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Chest/Mediastinum/Thymic rebound\|Thymic rebound]] (young), brown fat, muscle activity.
- Marrow and splenic uptake after G-CSF or recent chemo.
