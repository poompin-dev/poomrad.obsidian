> [!summary]
> CGD is an inherited phagocyte dysfunction (NADPH oxidase oxidative burst failure) causing recurrent deep infections and granulomatous inflammation. Imaging clue: multi-site, recurrent abscesses and pneumonias, often with fungal-pattern lung disease and liver abscesses, in a young patient (classically male).

## Pathophysiology
- Poor intracellular killing by neutrophils/macrophages → persistent infection
- Chronic inflammation → granulomas that can behave like obstructing masses

## Imaging patterns
### Chest (most common)

> [!info]
> Think CGD when CT shows recurrent multifocal infection with nodules, cavitation, and abscess, especially if fungal infection is suspected.
- Recurrent pneumonia: patchy or lobar consolidation, often multi-lobar over time
- Multiple nodules (can wax/wane); may cavitate
- Lung abscess or necrotising pneumonia
- Fungal disease (classically Aspergillus): nodules ± surrounding ground-glass, cavitation, pleural-based lesions
- Complications: bronchiectasis can develop after repeated infections
### Lymph nodes
- Suppurative lymphadenitis: enlarged nodes with central low attenuation and rim enhancement
- Mediastinal nodes can mimic TB/lymphoma depending on context
### Liver and spleen

> [!tip]
> Multiple hepatic abscesses in a child or young adult with recurrent infections is a strong CGD-shaped clue.
- Multiple hepatic abscesses; sometimes “cold” clinically relative to imaging
- Splenic microabscesses or larger splenic abscesses
- US for detection, CT/MRI for extent, complications, and drain planning
### Gastrointestinal tract
- Granulomatous colitis that can mimic Crohn disease
- Imaging: bowel wall thickening, hyperenhancement, strictures; perianal disease can occur
- Pitfall: calling it Crohn without integrating infection history
### Genitourinary obstruction
- Granulomas can cause focal inflammatory masses leading to obstruction
- Hydronephrosis or bladder outlet symptoms with atypical infection history should prompt immune defect consideration
### Bones and soft tissues
- Chronic osteomyelitis (including unusual organisms)
- Deep soft-tissue abscesses (psoas, abdominal wall, perineal), recurrent or multifocal

## Microbiology clue words

> [!important] clues
> Catalase-positive organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Nocardia; plus **Aspergillus** (big one).
## Differential
- TB or atypical mycobacterial infection (nodes, lung)
- Lymphoma (nodes, systemic)
- Sarcoidosis (granulomas without suppuration)
- Crohn disease (GI)
- Other immunodeficiencies or iatrogenic immunosuppression

> [!warning]
> Imaging cannot diagnose CGD. The radiology value is pattern recognition and prompting immune evaluation early, especially when disease recurs, is multi-site, or looks fungal/atypical.
