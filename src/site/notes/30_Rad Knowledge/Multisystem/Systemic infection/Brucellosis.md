## Clinical & Epidemiological Context

> **Key Concept:** A granulomatous zoonosis that acts as a "Great Mimicker" of Tuberculosis and Sarcoidosis.

* **Pathogen:** *Brucella* spp. (*B. melitensis* is the most virulent).
* **Thailand/SE Asia Relevance:**
    * Endemic in goat/cattle farming regions.
    * **The Diagnostic Trap:** Clinically indistinguishable from **Tuberculosis (TB)** without imaging/serology. Misdiagnosis leads to inappropriate anti-TB therapy.
* **Clinical Triad:** Undulant fever + Arthralgia + Hepatosplenomegaly.

## 1. Spinal Brucellosis (Brucellar Spondylitis)
*The most common osteoarticular manifestation (~50%).*
### Distribution
* **Region:** Lumbar (L4-L5) > Thoracic > Cervical.
* **Pattern:** Typically involves **two contiguous vertebrae** and the intervening disc.
### Imaging Morphology: The "Pedro Pons" Sign
The radiological hallmark is the **anterosuperior vertebral corner lesion**.
* **Radiography/CT:**
    * **Pedro Pons Sign:** Focal erosion of the anterosuperior vertebral endplate.
    * **Reactive Sclerosis:** Significant bony sclerosis surrounding the erosion (more prominent than in TB).
    * **Osteophytes:** "Parrot-beak" or bridging osteophytes develop early (an attempt at healing).
    * **Intradiscal Gas:** Vacuum phenomenon may occur due to **ischemic necrosis** of the disc (rare in TB/Pyogenic, where proteolytic enzymes cause liquefaction).
### MRI Findings (Gold Standard)
* **T1:** Hypointense disc and adjacent vertebral bodies.
* **T2/STIR:**
    * **Disc:** Hyperintense (morphology often preserved longer than in pyogenic infection).
    * **Bone Marrow:** Diffuse edema in the involved vertebrae.
    * **Abscesses:**
        * **Morphology:** Unlike the large, flowing "cold abscess" of TB, Brucella abscesses are **small, spherical, and focal**.
        * **Location:** Usually limited to the level of the lesion (paravertebral).
        * **Enhancement:** Homogeneous or thick peripheral enhancement.
* **Epidural extension:** Common but usually causes less cord compression than TB.

---
## 2. Sacroiliitis (High Yield MSK)
*Often overlooked but highly specific when present with fever.*
* **Frequency:** High prevalence (up to 40–50% of osteoarticular cases).
* **Laterality:** Typically **unilateral** (crucial differentiation from Spondyloarthropathies like Ankylosing Spondylitis, which are bilateral/symmetric).
* **Imaging:**
    * Blurring of articular margins.
    * Joint space widening (early) $\rightarrow$ narrowing/ankylosis (late).
    * **Pearl:** Unilateral sacroiliitis in a patient with fever $\rightarrow$ **Think Brucella.**

---
## 3. Neurobrucellosis
*Rare (<5%) but a high-yield exam topic due to mimicry.*
### Patterns of Involvement
1.  **Meningitis (Most Common):** Thickening and enhancement of the **basal meninges** (mimics TB, Fungal, or Sarcoidosis).
2.  **White Matter Changes:**
    * Multiple T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in periventricular white matter.
    * **The Mimic:** Can appear identical to **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**, **ADEM**, or **Neuro-Behçet's**.
3.  **Vascular:** Arteritis leading to lacunar infarcts or venous sinus thrombosis.
4.  **Cranial Nerves:** Enhancement of CN VIII (Sensorineural hearing loss).

---
## 4. Hepatosplenic Brucellosis
*Hepatosplenomegaly is the most common radiographic finding overall.*
* **Acute:** Non-specific hepatosplenomegaly.
* **Chronic (Brucelloma):**
    * **"Bull's Eye" Lesion:** Central calcification with a surrounding hypodense halo (CT) or hypointense rim (MRI).
    * **Snowflake Calcification:** Diffuse, flocculent calcifications in the spleen/liver (late stage).

---
## 5. Scrotal/Genitourinary
* **Brucellar Orchiepididymitis:**
    * Usually unilateral enlargement.
    * **US:** Heterogeneous echotexture, thickened epididymis, +/- testicular abscess.
    * **Note:** Indistinguishable from standard bacterial epididymo-orchitis on imaging alone; requires clinical correlation.

## Differential Diagnosis: The "Thailand Trap" (TB vs. Brucella)
*In Thailand, distinguishing these two is the primary diagnostic challenge.*

| Feature | Brucellosis | Tuberculous Spondylitis (Pott's) | Pyogenic Spondylitis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Destruction** | **Milder.** Architecture often preserved. | **Severe.** Vertebral collapse (Gibbus) is common. | Moderate to severe (rapid). |
| **Osteophytes** | **Prominent/Early.** "Parrot Beaks". | Mild or late stage only. | Minimal. |
| **Abscess** | **Small**, focal, spherical. | **Large**, "cold", sub-ligamentous spread. | Large, phlegmonous, ill-defined. |
| **Disc Height** | Often preserved until late. | Loss of disc height (late). | Rapid destruction/loss. |
| **Sclerosis** | **Prominent** reactive sclerosis. | Minimal early; sclerosis = healing. | Variable. |
| **Specific Sign** | **Pedro Pons Sign** (Anterosuperior erosion). | Sub-ligamentous spread. | Diffuse endplate destruction. |

## Guidelines & Management (NICE / RCR / Thai Context)

### Diagnostic Pathway
1.  **Suspect:** Back pain + Fever + Animal exposure/Unpasteurized dairy.
2.  **First Line:** MRI Spine (contrast essential).
3.  **Confirmation:**
    * **Serology is King:** Standard Agglutination Test (SAT) > 1:160.
    * **Biopsy Caution:** **Avoid if possible.** If serology is positive, biopsy is contraindicated due to aerosolization risk to lab staff (**Level 3 Biohazard**).

### Thai Guideline Nuance
* In equivocal cases (TB vs. Brucella):
    * Assess for concomitant pulmonary findings (favor TB).
    * Look for "Snowflake" splenic calcifications (favor Brucella).
    * **Do not** start empiric anti-TB treatment solely based on spinal granulomas without ruling out Brucella.

### Radiological Pearls

> [!TIP]
> * **The Hallmark:** Anterosuperior erosion + Sclerosis + Osteophytes = **Pedro Pons Sign**.
> * **The Mimic:** White matter lesions + Fever + Back pain $\rightarrow$ **Neurobrucellosis** (Not MS).
> * **The Negative:** Brucella rarely causes the massive gibbus deformity seen in TB.
