## Overview
- Congenital cystic lesions derived from the **embryonic foregut**.
- In children, mediastinal foregut duplication cysts account for a significant proportion of mediastinal masses (often quoted ~10%+).
- Belong to the broader **foregut/enteric duplication cyst** family:
	- Respiratory-type: **bronchogenic cysts**
	- GI-type: **oesophageal / enteric duplication** and **neurenteric cysts**

## Aetiology / Embryology
- Result from **abnormal budding, separation or duplication** of the primitive foregut and adjacent structures.
- Similar duplication cysts can occur anywhere along the oesophagus–stomach–intestine, but this note focuses on **mediastinal** foregut duplication cysts.

## Clinical
- Often asymptomatic, found incidentally.
- Symptomatic when large or complicated:
  - **Mass effect** → cough, wheeze, dyspnoea, chest pain.
  - **Oesophageal compression** → dysphagia.
  - **Infection** → fever, acute chest pain.
  - Rare: haemorrhage, rupture, or spinal cord symptoms if neurenteric with intraspinal component.

## Histologic type (subtypes)

### Bronchogenic cyst
- **Embryology**
	- Error in lung budding from the **ventral division** of the embryonic foregut.
- **Histology**
	- Lined by **ciliated pseudostratified respiratory epithelium**.
	- Wall contains **smooth muscle, mucous glands and often cartilage**.

### Oesophageal / enteric duplication cyst
- **Embryology**
	- Error in development/duplication of the **posterior division** of the embryonic foregut (oesophagus).
- **Histology**
	- Lined by **GI-type mucosa** (squamous, gastric or intestinal).
	- Well-formed **muscularis propria in two layers** (inner circular, outer longitudinal) – mimics normal gut wall.

### Neurenteric cyst
- **Embryology**
	- Failure of separation between **endoderm (foregut)** and **notochord/neural tube (ectoderm)**.
	- Persistent communication → **neurenteric canal (canal of Kovalevsky)**, a form of spinal dysraphism.
- **Histology**
	- Lined by **enteric-type epithelium**, often with mucin-secreting cells; may have smooth muscle in the wall.
	- No cartilage (helps distinguish from bronchogenic).
- **Key idea**
	- “Enteric-type duplication cyst that has a relationship with the spine/vertebrae”.

## Imaging

### General features (all foregut duplication cysts)
- Well-circumscribed, **fluid-attenuation** mass.
- **Non-enhancing contents** with possible **thin rim enhancement** of the wall.
- May show:
	- Higher internal attenuation or mild T1 hyperintensity if proteinaceous or haemorrhagic.
	- **Partially calcified wall** in some chronic lesions.
- **Red flag**: solid internal **enhancing** components → think alternative diagnosis (cystic tumour, lymphangioma, necrotic nodes) rather than a simple duplication cyst.

### Bronchogenic cyst
- **Location**
	- Classically **middle mediastinum**, close to central airways:
		- Subcarinal, paratracheal, perihilar.
	- Can also be intrapulmonary.
- **Imaging**
	- CXR: round/oval mediastinal or hilar mass.
	- CT: water or soft-tissue density; may show air–fluid level if communication with bronchial tree.
	- MRI: T2 bright, variable T1.
- **Clue**
	- “Cyst hugging the **airway** with respiratory histology ± cartilage”.

### Oesophageal / enteric duplication cyst
- **Location**
	- **Middle or posterior mediastinum**, intimately related to the **oesophagus**; often shares a wall.
- **Imaging**
	- CT/MRI: fluid-attenuation/signal cyst along the expected oesophageal course.
	- Can be tubular, paralleling oesophagus.
- **Clue**
	- “Cyst stuck to the **oesophagus**, not the airway; GI-type wall with muscularis propria”.

### Neurenteric cyst
- **Location**
	- Often **posterior mediastinum** with possible **intraspinal extension**.
	- Classic in spine: **intradural extramedullary, ventral to the spinal cord**, usually cervical or thoracic.
- **Imaging**
  - CT: posterior mediastinal cyst ± bony anomaly.
  - MRI:
	- T1: iso to mildly hyperintense relative to CSF.
	- T2: hyperintense.
	- Minimal or no internal enhancement; thin wall.
  - Frequently associated **vertebral anomalies**:
	- Hemivertebra, butterfly vertebra, anterior spina bifida, scoliosis.
- **Clue**
	- “Posterior mediastinal ± intraspinal cyst + vertebral anomaly = **neurenteric** until proven otherwise”.

## Exam nuggets
- **Umbrella vs subtype**
	- “Foregut duplication cyst” = umbrella term.
	- Subtypes by histology + location: **bronchogenic**, **oesophageal/enteric duplication**, **neurenteric**.
- **Key differentials for mediastinal cyst**
	- Pericardial cyst, thymic cyst, lymphangioma.
	- Cystic teratoma, cystic thymoma, necrotic lymph node.
- **Shortcuts
	- Airway-related + cartilage → **bronchogenic cyst**.
	- Oesophagus-related + proper GI muscularis propria → **oesophageal/enteric duplication cyst**.
	- Posterior mediastinum + vertebral anomaly ± intraspinal component → **neurenteric cyst**.
