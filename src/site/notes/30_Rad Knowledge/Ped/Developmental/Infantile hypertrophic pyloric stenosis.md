> [!summary]
> Hypertrophy of the pyloric circular muscle → fixed gastric outlet obstruction in young infants (classically the “hungry vomiter” 2–8 weeks old). Ultrasound is diagnostic; treatment is pyloromyotomy after correcting dehydration and metabolic alkalosis.

## Epidemiology
- Onset: typically **3–5 weeks** of life (range ~2–12 weeks)
- **Male predominance** (~4:1)
- More common in **firstborn** infants
- ↑ incidence in **preterm** infants
- Overall frequency: ~1–2 per 1000 live births

## Risk factors
- **Feeding / perinatal**
	- Bottle feeding
	- Preterm birth
	- Caesarean section
- **Maternal**
	- Maternal smoking in pregnancy
- **Neonatal**
	- Macrolide antibiotics in the first weeks of life (e.g. erythromycin, azithromycin)
- **Genetic / familial**
	- Positive family history (siblings or parents with IHPS)

## Pathophysiology
- Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the **pyloric circular muscle** with mucosal oedema
- Narrow, elongated, **non-relaxing pyloric canal** → progressive gastric outlet obstruction
- Result: increasingly forceful gastric peristalsis against a fixed obstruction

## Clinical presentation
- Initially well infant, then:
	- Onset of symptoms at **3–5 weeks**
	- **Non-bilious, projectile vomiting** shortly after feeds
	- Often still **hungry after vomiting** (“hungry vomiter”)
- With time:
	- **Poor weight gain / weight loss**, constipation
	- Signs of **dehydration**
	- Examination:
	- **Epigastric fullness** and sometimes **visible peristaltic waves** (L→R)
	- Palpable **“olive”**: firm, mobile mass in the right upper quadrant / epigastrium
- Biochemistry (after prolonged vomiting):
	- **Hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis**
	- ± **paradoxical aciduria** in more advanced cases

## Imaging

### Imaging of choice – Ultrasound
- First-line, essentially replaces routine contrast studies
- Advantages: no radiation, quick, highly sensitive/specific when done well
- Technique:
	- High-frequency linear probe
	- Supine or right lateral decubitus / right posterior oblique
	- Feed a small amount of fluid during scan to assess **dynamic passage** through pylorus

#### Key sonographic appearances
All of these are supportive evidence (adjunctive to measurement diagnostic criteria)
- **Transverse plane**
	- **“Target / doughnut sign”**: hypoechoic hypertrophied muscle as a ring around echogenic mucosa
- **Longitudinal plane**
	- **“Cervix sign”**: elongated pyloric canal and hypertrophied muscle resembling a uterine cervix
	- **“Antral nipple sign”**: redundant pyloric mucosa protruding into the antrum
	- "Double track sign": two parallel echogenic lines within the pyloric canal, with a thin hypoechoic/anechoic stripe between them.
- **Dynamic**
	- Little or **no passage of gastric contents** through the pylorus into the duodenum despite persistent gastric peristalsis

#### Ultrasound diagnostic criteria
Most commonly used abnormal thresholds (infants <3 months):

- **Pyloric muscle thickness**
	- **> 3 mm** = abnormal / highly suspicious for IHPS  
	- 2–3 mm = **equivocal** → repeat scan, consider clinical course and [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pylorospasm\|Pylorospasm]]
- **Pyloric canal length**
	- **≥ 15–16 mm** = abnormal
	- < 12 mm usually normal; 12–15 mm = grey zone (correlate clinically, repeat)
- **Transverse pyloric diameter (optional but nice to know)**
	- **> 11–12 mm** supportive of IHPS
- Always integrate:
	- Measurements **+ non-passage of gastric contents** + compatible clinical picture

> [!tip]
> Exam-safe: “Muscle thickness >3 mm and canal length ≥15–16 mm in a vomiting infant, with no gastric contents traversing the pylorus, is diagnostic of IHPS on ultrasound.”

### Other imaging
- **Plain abdominal radiograph**
	- Distended, air-filled stomach
	- Paucity of distal bowel gas
	- **“[[70_Glossary/Ped/Caterpillar sign\|Caterpillar stomach]]”**: prominent gastric peristaltic waves indenting the greater curvature
- **Upper GI contrast study** (if US equivocal or unavailable)
	- **“[[70_Glossary/Ped/String sign\|String sign]]”**: thin streak of contrast through narrowed pyloric canal
	- **“Shoulder / tit signs”**: impression of hypertrophied pylorus on antrum / lesser curve
- These are now more viva/MCQ material than real-world first-line tests.
## Treatment
- **Initial**
	- Correct **dehydration and electrolyte disturbances** (especially Cl⁻, K⁺, H⁺)
	- Normalise acid–base status before surgery
- **Definitive**
	- **Ramstedt pyloromyotomy** (open or laparoscopic): excision of muscular layer, no mucosal breach.
	- Excellent prognosis when treated
- Post-op:
	- Vomiting may persist transiently for 24–48 h but should improve
	- Recurrence is rare

## Exam nuggets
- “2–8 week old **firstborn boy** with **projectile non-bilious vomiting**, still hungry, with a palpable **olive** and **visible gastric peristalsis**.”
- Biochemistry buzzword: **hypochloraemic hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis**
- Ultrasound: **muscle ≥3 mm**, **length ≥15–16 mm**, **no passage** of stomach contents
- Management phrase: “Resuscitate and correct electrolytes first, then **Ramstedt pyloromyotomy**.”
