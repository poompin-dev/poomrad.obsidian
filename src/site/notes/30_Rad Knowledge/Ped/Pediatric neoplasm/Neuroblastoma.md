## Key points
- The most common solid **extracranial** malignancy in the paediatric population (still rare: ~1–3 per 100,000 per year).
- Part of the [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Neuroblastic tumour spectrum\|Neuroblastic tumour spectrum]] (neural crest–derived [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Soft tissue tumor/Sarcoma/Small round blue cell tumours\|small round blue cell tumor]] of the sympathetic nervous system).
	- Can arise anywhere along the **sympathetic chain** (cervical to pelvis).
	- Most commonly involves:
		- **Adrenal medulla**
		- Retroperitoneum
		- Posterior [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Chest ped/Mediastinal masses (Ped)#Neuroblastoma\|mediastinum]]
- Onset commonly **< 2 years old** (younger than [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Renal masses/Wilms tumour\|Wilms tumour]] which peaks around 3 years).
- Buzzword patho: **Homer Write rosettes** (circular orientation of neuroblastoma cells around neuropil)

> [!summary] Mental model
> **“Calcified, suprarenal, vessel-encasing mass in a very young child with bone ± liver mets” → neuroblastoma until proven otherwise.**

---
## Imaging features
- **Large heterogeneous mass** (“big fucking mass”).
- Heterogeneous due to internal **haemorrhage, necrosis, and calcification**.
- **Internal mottled / coarse calcification** (much more common than in Wilms).
- MRI: **hyperintense T2**, hypointense T1, heterogeneous enhancement.
- Tends to **encase / engulf vascular structures** (aorta, IVC, renal vessels) rather than true intraluminal tumour thrombus as in [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Renal masses/Wilms tumour\|Wilms tumour]].
	- Vascular invasion / tumour thrombus is **rare**.
- Frequently invades **paraspinal muscles** and the **neural foramina**, especially at thoracolumbar levels → **dumbbell-shaped tumour** (best seen on MRI).
- May cause spinal cord compression when there is significant intraspinal extension.

## Staging systems (INSS vs INRG)

- **INSS** (International Neuroblastoma Staging System)
	- **Post-surgical** staging (depends on extent of resection, operative findings, nodal status).
	- Classic special stage: **4S** (infants <12 months, limited metastases to liver/skin/marrow).

- **INRG / [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/INRG Staging System (INRGSS) & Image-Defined Risk Factors (IDRFs)\|INRGSS]]** (International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System)
	- **Pre-treatment, imaging-based** staging.
	- Uses **IDRFs (Image Defined Risk Factors)** to define local stage and surgical risk.
	- Stages:
		- **L1** – Localised tumour, **no IDRFs**.
		- **L2** – Locoregional tumour, **one or more IDRFs**.
		- **M** – Distant metastases.
		- **MS** – “4S-like” special infant stage (<18 months, mets limited to liver/skin/limited marrow).

> [!tip]
> Exam-safe: **INSS = surgeon-based, post-op. INRG = radiologist-based, pre-treatment, IDRF-driven.**

## Distant metastasis evaluation
At the time of diagnosis, neuroblastoma frequently already metastasises to **bone/bone marrow (50%), lymph nodes, and liver**. Since most tumors are MIBG-avid, MIBG is the first choice and **mandatory** imaging for metastasis evaluation at the time of evaluation in most guidelines.

### Bone metastasis
#### MIBG scintigraphy/SPECT/CT
- Main functional imaging due to best accuracy/reliability (and cheaper than other choices in most settings).
- Also use for monitoring treatment response and follow up.
- Any uptake in bone = metastasis since normal bone do not physiologically uptake any MIBG (very useful in paediatric population since they are skeletally immature).

> [!Caution] PracticalPoints  
		> Beware of focal increased activity in the **left iliac crest** – may be due to a recent bone marrow biopsy rather than true metastasis. Always check the clinical history to avoid mis-staging.

#### FDG18-PET/CT
 - Useful for locating primary lesion and soft tissue metastasis in non-MIBG avid cases.
 - Limit evaluation in area adjacent to organ with high physiologic uptake e.g. skull base (brain).

#### Whole body MRI
- Coronal whole body STIR is very sensitive to detected marrow change but may be less specific compared with MIBG imaging.

Skeletal survey and bone scan are no longer standard of practice.

Dedicated radiograph or CT at the area with equivocal MIBG lesions may be helpful. Classic findings include:
- Moth-eaten lytic diffuse lesion involves metadiaphysis.
- Aggressive periosteal reaction seen as multiple perpendicular spike with soft tissue formation.
### Other metastatic sites
#### Liver
Mainly observed in infants along with subcutaneous metastasis ([[70_Glossary/Ped/Blueberry muffin baby\|Blueberry muffin baby]]). 
Two forms of manifestation:
- Focal masses
- Diffuse infiltration (can be missed at CT since it can be subtle and just looks like big liver).
#### Lung and pleura
Overall, no specific pattern.
- Rarely observed, more common among MYCN-amplified tumours.
- CT is the best method to identify small lung nodules.

> [!warning]
> **Ascites and pleural effusion** do **not** automatically mean stage M (even with present of malignant cytology, and they are rare anyway), unless they are **remote from the compartment** of the primary; describe them, but metastasis depends on actual nodal/bony/organ spread.

### CNS
Brain parenchyma and meningeal metastatic disease are very rare (unlike spinal involvement). 

> [!Caution] 
> If optic nerve compression is suspected (due to skull base involvement seen on MIBG or clinical), CT/MRI brain is warranted mainly for optic nerve evaluation not for brain metastasis.

## Special stages

These stages are associated with favourable prognosis (spontaneous regression) seen in younger patients.

- **INSS 4S**
	- Age <12 months.
	- Localised primary (stage 1 or 2).
	- Metastases limited to **liver, skin, and/or bone marrow**

- **INRG MS**
	- Age <18 months.
	- Primary tumour can be **L1 or L2**.
	- Metastases again confined to **liver, skin, and/or bone marrow**

Both MS and 4S require BM involvement **less than 10%** of total nucleated cells, and **no cortical bone** involvement.

## Special entities

- **Pepper syndrome**
	- Clinical pattern of **massive liver metastases** in an infant with neuroblastoma.
	- Marked hepatomegaly → **respiratory compromise** ± abdominal compartment issues.
	- Usually falls within the **4S/MS group**, but **Pepper = phenotype**, not a separate stage.

> [!warning]
> Not all 4S/MS have Pepper syndrome, but most Pepper babies are **4S/MS**.

- **[[70_Glossary/Ped/Blueberry muffin baby\|Blueberry muffin baby]]**
	- In **4S / MS** neuroblastoma, metastases can involve the **skin**, appearing as multiple **blue-purple papules/nodules** (dermal/subcutaneous deposits).
	- Clinically this can mimic **“blueberry muffin” baby**, but remember this pattern is **not specific** – TORCH infections, extramedullary haematopoiesis (due to marrow infiltration or haemolytic anemia), congenital leukaemia and LCH can look similar.

## Tumour genetics
Certain tumour genetics in neuroblastoma have prognostic implications.

However, most cases are otherwise normal without associated abnormalities.
