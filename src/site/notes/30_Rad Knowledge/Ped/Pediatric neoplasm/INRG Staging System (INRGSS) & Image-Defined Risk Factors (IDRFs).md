> [!summary] Core idea
Pre-treatment, **imaging-based staging** for [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Neuroblastoma\|neuroblastoma]], designed so patients can be staged *before* any surgery or biopsy.  
It pairs with **IDRFs** to predict surgical risk and guide whether upfront resection is safe.

Although ultrasound is generally the first-line imaging modality for paediatric patients presenting with a palpable mass, if [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Neuroblastoma\|neuroblastoma]] is suspected and needs detailed evaluation, **CT or MRI** is the recommended imaging modality for complete assessment of the primary lesion at diagnosis.
## INRGSS stages

| Stage  | Definition (simplified)                                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1** | Localised tumour, confined to **one body compartment** (neck / chest / abdomen / pelvis), **no IDRFs**.                                                           |
| **L2** | **Locoregional** tumour with **≥1 IDRF** and/or extension into **ipsilateral contiguous compartments** (e.g. chest–abdomen), but no distant mets.                 |
| **M**  | **Distant metastatic** disease (bone, marrow, non-regional nodes, lung, etc.), except MS pattern.                                                                 |
| **MS** | Metastatic disease in child **<18 months** (~<547 days), with mets **confined to skin, liver, and/or bone marrow** (<10% marrow cells, no cortical bone lesions). |

> [!tip] Notice
> **No special love for the midline** in INRGSS (unlike INSS stage 3). What matters is:  
> **compartments + IDRFs + metastatic pattern.**

## What are IDRFs?

**Image-Defined Risk Factors** = CT/MRI features that predict **difficult / high-risk surgery** (involvement of vital structure which dissection cannot preserve function, e.g. vascular encasement, intraspinal canal compromise, airway compression, porta hepatis invasion).

- **Any IDRF present → L2** (if otherwise locoregional).
- More IDRFs → higher risk of complications, more likely to need **induction chemo before resection**.
- IDRFs can **disappear** after chemo, allowing safer delayed surgery → post-induction/pre-operative imaging re-evaluation is recommended.

## Major IDRF categories (conceptual groupings)

> [!summary]
> Don’t memorise all 20; know the **patterns**:  
> **multi-compartment, vessels, airway, spinal canal, porta/mesentery/renal pedicle, pelvic notch.**

### 1. Multi-compartment extension
- Tumour extending into **two contiguous ipsilateral compartments**  
  (neck–chest, chest–abdomen, abdomen–pelvis) = **IDRF by itself**.
	- Non-contiguous disease in a different body compartment or non-regional nodes = metastatic (M/MS)
		- 1R/1L (Virchow nodes) are considered regional nodes in context of cervicothoracic primary.
		- Superior mediastinum nodes are considered regional nodes in context of thoracoabdominal primary.
		- Inguinal nodes are considered regional nodes re considered regional nodes in context of pelvic primary.

### 2. Vascular encasement
- **Neck / cervicothoracic**: encasement of **carotid, vertebral, subclavian vessels, internal jugular vein**.
- **Thorax / thoracoabdominal**: encasing **aorta** and major branches.
- **Abdomen / pelvis** (high-yield list):
	- Encasement of **coeliac axis** and/or **SMA origin**.
	- Involvement of **SMA branches at mesenteric root**.
	- **Renal pedicle(s)** involved (artery and/or vein).
	- Encasement of **aorta, IVC, iliac vessels**.

> [!tip]
> **Encasement** = >180° arterial contact or non-visualised vein lumen → **IDRF**.  
> Mere contact (<180° artery, flattened but patent vein) is **not** an IDRF (except renal arteries are flagged more aggressively in practice).

> [!warning] Caution
> Special case for **renal pedicle(s)**: Any degree of contact (no need encasement) is considered IDRFs as this finding is specially increased surgical difficulty.
### 3. Airway compression
- Compression/narrowing of **trachea or main bronchi** (as seen in short axis) = IDRF.
- Just displacement without luminal narrowing = not IDRF.

### 4. Infiltration of adjacent organs / porta / mesentery
- Infiltration of:
	- **Porta hepatis / hepatoduodenal ligament**.
	- **Duodeno-pancreatic block** or mesenteric root.
	- **Pericardium, diaphragm, kidney, liver, mesentery** (true invasion = blurring of tumor/organ interfaces or loss of demonstrable separate fat plane, not just displacement).

### 5. Intraspinal extension

**Not every dumbbell tumour = IDRF.**

IDRF only if **any** of:
- Tumour occupies **>1/3 of canal** in axial plane, **or**
- **Perimedullary CSF space obliterated**, **or**
- **Cord signal abnormal** (oedema/myelopathy).

If intraspinal component is small with preserved CSF rim and normal cord signal → **no IDRF**.

### 6. Pelvis
- Tumour **encasing iliac vessels**, or  
- **Crossing the sciatic notch** (cross the oblique line from ischial spine to lateral sacral body, risk to plexus/sciatic nerve).

### 7. Thoracoabdominal
Lower mediastinal tumour infiltrating the **costovertebral junction between T9 and T12** → IDRF because of theoretical risk of injuring the **artery of Adamkiewicz / anterior spinal artery** and causing cord ischaemia.

## Reporting terminology (INRG imaging committee flavour)

> [!tip]
> Use these words in your report – they map directly to **L1 vs L2**.

- **Separation**: fat plane preserved between tumour and vital structure → **L1**.
- **Contact**: fat plane lost, but
	- Artery contact <180°
	- vein flattened but lumen visible → generally **L1**.
- **Encasement**: artery contact >180° and/or vein lumen not seen → **IDRF → L2**.
- **Compression** (airway only) – reduced airway calibre → **IDRF → L2**.
- **Invasion**
	- Renal pedicle(s): any degree of contact
	- Intraspinal extension
- **Multi-compartment**: contiguous ipsilateral compartments involved → **IDRF → L2**.
- **Multifocal disease**: separate primaries; **not** an IDRF but stage using **worst lesion**.
	- Can be synchronous or metachronous.
	- Rare, usually seen in familial or syndromic context.
