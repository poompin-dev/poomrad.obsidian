## Key points
- Persistent metanephric blastema (beyond GA 36 wks) = nephrogenic rest
- Nephroblastomatosis = **premalignant**; carries increased risk of developing Wilms tumour, often bilateral/multifocal.
- Mostly seen in infancy (may not be detectable on initial imaging study); many lesions regress over time, but some persist or progress.
- May develop into [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Renal masses/Wilms tumour\|Wilms tumour]] within the lesion ➞ need regular surveillance (often screening renal US at ~3 months until about 7-8 years; local protocol dependent)

## Type
- **Perilobar:**
	- Peripheral cortex, subcapsular “rind” pattern.
	- **Syndromes:** Beckwith–Wiedemann, isolated hemihypertrophy, Perlman, trisomy 18.
- **Intralobar:**
	- Anywhere in parenchyma, patchy / nodular.
	- **Higher Wilms risk.**
	- **Syndromes:** Denys–Drash, [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/WAGR\|WAGR]], sporadic aniridia.

## Imaging
### Key imaging features
Typically appear as **cortical, subcapsular, homogeneous, hypoenhancing** tissue forming a rind or multiple small nodules; can be diffuse or multifocal.
### Differentiating features from Wilms tumour
- In one series, a lesion size **<1.75 cm** had very high NPV (≈100%) and ~80% PPV for being a rest rather than Wilms – useful as a **rough rule**, but not absolute.
- Wilms tumour is usually spherical in shape & more likely to be exophytic.
	- Nephrogenic rests: more **flat/rind-like, cortical, intraparenchymal**.
	- Wilms: **larger, lobulated, mass effect, distortion/exophytic**.
### Imaging findings suggesting conversion to Wilms tumour
- Rapid ↑ in size
- Stable or ↑ size while on chemotherapy (should shrink if it’s just rest under chemo)
- Nodule within initial lesions
- New heterogeneous appearance of mass
