> [!summary] TLDR;
Common paediatric renal malignancy (~age 3–4). Large renal-origin mass with “claw sign”, heterogeneous enhancement, necrosis/haemorrhage, displaces rather than encases vessels; venous tumour thrombus (renal vein/IVC) is a key complication. Main ddx: [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Neuroblastoma\|neuroblastoma]] (arising from adrenal gland).

## Epidemiology & context
- Peak: early childhood; can be bilateral/synchronous or metachronous.
- Associations: nephrogenic rests ([[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Renal masses/Nephroblastomatosis\|nephroblastomatosis]]), [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/WAGR\|WAGR]], Beckwith–Wiedemann, Denys–Drash, others.
## Clinical clues
- Painless abdominal mass, abdominal pain, haematuria, anaemia; possible renin-mediated hypertension.
- Do NOT palpate vigorously (rupture risk).

___
## Imaging
### Ultrasound
- Large, well-defined **renal mass**; renal parenchyma forming **claw sign**.
- Heterogeneous echotexture with necrosis/haemorrhage; distortion of collecting system.
- Doppler: assess **renal vein/IVC** for bland vs tumour thrombus; look for contralateral nephrogenic rests.
### CT
- Heterogeneous soft-tissue mass arising from kidney; **calcification uncommon** (cf. [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Neuroblastoma\|neuroblastoma]]).
- Enhances less than normal cortex; central low-attenuation necrosis; haemorrhage.
- Typically does **not cross midline as aggressively** as neuroblastoma; mass effect rather than infiltrative encasement.
- **Displacement** of aorta/IVC without frank encasement; lymph nodes in renal hilum/para-aortic.
- Chest CT: lung metastases (micronodules). ⚠️ Management of CT-only micromets differs between **COG vs SIOP**—follow local protocol.
### MRI 
- T1 low–intermediate; T2 intermediate–high; patchy non-enhancing necrosis/haemorrhage.
- **DWI**: shows restrict diffusion.
- Best for **venous extension** mapping (renal vein → IVC → right atrium) and contralateral kidney survey.

> [!tip] Practical protocol
Start with **US** → **contrast CT** abdomen/pelvis (or MRI if venous extension suspected/contrast contraindicated) + **chest imaging** per local guideline. Use **MRI** to define venous thrombus extent and contralateral nephrogenic rests.

___
## Venous extension
- Tumour thrombus in renal vein/IVC; can reach right atrium.
- On imaging: continuity with mass, enhancement, restricted diffusion; expand the vein lumen (vs bland thrombus).
- Level of thrombus (infrahepatic/retrohepatic/suprahepatic/atrial) should be reported for surgical planning.

## Spread & complications
- Lungs > liver > nodes; rare bone/brain.
- Rupture (pre/intra-op) → upstaging; peritoneal seeding.
- Bilateral disease or multifocality suggests background **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Renal masses/Nephroblastomatosis\|nephrogenic rests]]**.

## Staging (practical rad view/exam style)
Wilms staging is surgical–pathologic based. Different systems (NWTS/COG vs SIOP) exist, but the **1–5 numbering is the same idea**.
- **I**: confined to kidney, completely resected (renal capsule intact, no spill).
- **II**: extends beyond kidney (e.g., perinephric fat, renal sinus, renal vein) but completely resected (no gross spillage or +ve margins).
- **III**: **residual tumour confined to abdomen** (unresected metastatic nodes, spillage/rupture, +ve margins, **Biopsy before nephrectomy in COG**, tumour thrombus in **IVC/atrial tumour thrombus** not completely removed or removed separately).
- **IV**: haematogenous metastases (**lungs** are most common; **liver** next; **bone/brain** rare).
- **V**: **bilateral** renal tumours at presentation.

Don’t get baited by tumour size. Staging is **spread + surgical factors**, not cm cut-offs.
___
## Differential diagnosis
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Neuroblastoma\|Neuroblastoma]]:** 
	- Calcifications common, **encases** vessels, may cross midline.
	- Lacks renal **claw sign** (not arising from kidney).
	- ± Elevated catecholamine (VMA/HVA)
- **Clear cell sarcoma of kidney:** 
	- Renal mass with bone mets tendency (pathologic dx).
	- Imaging often mimics Wilms; suspect if bone mets or older age.
- **Malignant rhabdoid tumour:** 
	- Infants, aggressive; often calcifies; brain lesions (ATRT).
	- loss of INI1 (SMARCB1) on pathology (buzzword).
- **Congenital mesoblastic nephroma:**
	- Typical in **neonates / <3 months**
	- Solid, infiltrative; hypervascular ‘spindle cell’ tumour.
- **Multilocular cystic renal tumour / Cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma:** predominantly cystic; thick septa.
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal masses/Renal cell carcinoma\|Renal cell carcinoma]] (older child/adolescent):** consider if atypical age or calcified solid mass.
## Pearls vs neuroblastoma
- **Origin:** Wilms = renal; neuroblastoma = adrenal/para-spinal.
- **Vessels:** Wilms **displaces**; neuroblastoma **encases**.
- **Calcification:** rare in Wilms; common in neuroblastoma.
- **Thrombus:** venous tumour thrombus favours Wilms.
- **Claw sign:** present in Wilms; absent in neuroblastoma.
___
## Management notes (radiology-relevant)
- **NWTS/COG:** for unilateral, resectable Wilms → primary nephrectomy + nodal sampling; biopsy uncommon as it upstages to III.
- **SIOP:** image-based diagnosis → neoadjuvant chemotherapy → delayed nephrectomy; biopsy generally avoided unless atypical.
- Anticipate need for cardiothoracic input if IVC/right atrial thrombus.
## Follow-up & surveillance
- Post-therapy: assess residual mass, new lesions in contralateral kidney, venous patency, treatment-related lung/liver changes.
- Long-term: monitor for metachronous contralateral tumour in patients with nephrogenic rests/syndromic risk.

> [!warning] Pitfalls
Rupture/spillage (trauma or vigorous palpation) alters stage; cystic Wilms may mimic benign cystic lesions—look for enhancing solid nodules/septa and renal origin. Beware mistaking bland for tumour thrombus—use enhancement/DWI and continuity.
