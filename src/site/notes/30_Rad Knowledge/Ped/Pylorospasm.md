Mimic/ddx consideration for [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Developmental/Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis\|Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis]].

## Imaging
**Variable** pyloric appearance over the exam; **relaxes**; **contrast/contents pass** intermittently.
In contrast with [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Developmental/Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis\|IHPS]] which shows **persistent** abnormal pylorus across the exam; typically **progressive clinical course**.
## Key differences
- Intermittent functional contraction of the pylorus in irritable infants
- Present with regurgitation/vomiting may mimic reflux but no severe symptoms
- Initial imaging does not fulfil IHPS criteria on initial ultrasound; prolonged observation or repeat scan shows relaxation and resolution.
