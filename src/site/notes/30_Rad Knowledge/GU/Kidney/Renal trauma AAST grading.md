Anatomic severity of renal injury stratifies mainly by depth of laceration, collecting system involvement, and vascular injury/active bleeding.
## Grade I (minor)
- Contusion or subcapsular haematoma
- No laceration
## Grade II (mild)
- Perirenal haematoma confined to Gerota fascia
- Cortical laceration <= 1 cm depth, no collecting system injury, no urine extravasation
## Grade III (moderate)
- Laceration > 1 cm depth, no collecting system rupture, no urine extravasation
- Active bleeding or vascular injury that is contained within Gerota fascia (still “contained”)
## Grade IV (high grade)
Any of:
- Laceration into collecting system with urinary extravasation
- Renal pelvis laceration and/or complete ureteropelvic junction disruption
- Segmental renal artery or vein injury
- Active bleeding extending beyond Gerota fascia (into retroperitoneum or peritoneum)
- Segmental or global infarction(s) from vessel thrombosis without active bleeding
## Grade V (critical)
- Main renal artery or vein laceration, or hilar avulsion
- Devascularised kidney with active bleeding (2018 revision nuance)
