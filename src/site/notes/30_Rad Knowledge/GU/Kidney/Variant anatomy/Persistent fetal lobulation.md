---

Normal anatomical variant where fetal renal lobulations persist into adulthood, causing shallow external cortical clefts between renal pyramids without cortical loss or parenchymal scarring.

## Key imaging features
- External **scalloped/indented renal outline**.
- Clefts lie **between medullary pyramids**, aligned with interlobar arteries.
- **Cortical thickness preserved** between clefts and calyces.
- No associated:
	- Cortical thinning
	- Deformity of calyces
	- Focal volume loss or contour flattening.

## Main differential (vs renal scarring)

| Feature                 | Persistent fetal lobulation                          | Renal scarring (e.g. reflux / chronic pyelo)           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Location of indentation | Between pyramids (interlobar region)                 | Over a pyramid                                         |
| Cortical thickness      | Preserved, normal thickness                          | Thinned cortex at site of scar                         |
| Calyces                 | Normal shape and orientation                         | Clubbing, distortion, retraction of adjacent calyx     |
| Parenchymal volume      | No focal volume loss                                 | Focal volume loss, kidney may be small if advanced     |
| Overall impression      | Normal variant, symmetrical, smooth internal anatomy | Acquired damage, often asymmetric, associated with CKD |
## Exam nuggets
- Common normal variant in adults; often bilateral.
- Classic Q: “How to distinguish from scarring?” → **look for cortical thinning + calyceal deformity** (present in scar, absent in fetal lobulation).
