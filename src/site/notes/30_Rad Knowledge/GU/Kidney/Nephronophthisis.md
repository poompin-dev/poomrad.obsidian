Nephronophthisis = **autosomal recessive tubulointerstitial kidney disease** that is a **leading genetic cause of end-stage renal failure in children/teens.**

## Concept
- Primary disease of the **tubules + interstitium**, not the glomeruli.
- Progressive **tubular atrophy, basement membrane disruption, interstitial fibrosis* → chronic kidney failure.
- Often a **ciliopathy** (genes encoding primary cilia proteins), so can be **syndromic** (retinal dystrophy, cerebellar anomalies, liver fibrosis, etc).
## Clinical picture
- Inheritance: **autosomal recessive**.
- Main forms: infantile, **juvenile (most common)**, adolescent.
- Kids/teens with:
	- Polyuria, polydipsia (concentrating defect, like nephrogenic DI-ish)
	- Growth retardation, anaemia, fatigue
	- Salt wasting, mild or absent oedema
- **Urine:** usually bland or only mild proteinuria/haematuria – doesn’t look like classic glomerulonephritis.
- Progresses to **ESRD before adulthood** in most classic cases.

## Imaging
- **US:**
	- Kidneys **small or normal size**, **increased echogenicity**, **poor corticomedullary differentiation**
	- ± **small cysts at the corticomedullary junction** (but cysts may be subtle or late).
- CT/MR not usually first-line; mainly show small kidneys ± corticomedullary cysts.
## Associations
- When combined with **retinal dystrophy** → **Senior–Løken syndrome**.
- Other overlaps with [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/CNS developmental anomalies/Posterior fossa/Joubert syndrome\|Joubert]] spectrum and other ciliopathies.
