The most common primary renal malignancy
## Key imaging characteristics
- Enhances (>15 HU)
	- <10 HU = no sig.
	- 10-15 HU = equivocal, suspicious if large (>1.5 cm)
- Calcifications in a fatty mass
	- If no Ca2+ → AML
## Risk factors
- Tobacco use
- Chronic dialysis (>3 years)
- Family history
- Cancer syndrome
	- VHL

## Subtypes
### Clear cell
- The most common subtype in general population
- Assoc. with VHL
- More aggressive than papillary
- Enhance equal to the cortex on corticomedullary phase
### Papillary
- The second most common subtype
	- Likely to occurs in transplanted kidney
- Less aggressive than clear cell
- Less vascular → enhance less than cortex on corticomedullary phase
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal masses/Ddx of renal hypoT2 lesions\|Ddx of renal hypoT2 lesions]]: lipid poor AML, hemorrhagic cyst
### Medullary
- Typically younger patient
- Assoc. with sickle cell trait
- Highly aggressive → usually large and metastasized at the time of diagnosis
### Chromophobe
- Assoc. with Birt Hogg Dube syndrome
### Translocation
- Most common subtype in kids
- Assoc. with prior cytotoxic chemotherapy

## Staging
- Limit to kidney
	- **I**: < 7 cm
	- **II**: > 7 cm
- Extended beyond renal capsule but still inside Gerota's fascia: **III**
	- I**IIA**: Invaded renal vein
	- **IIIB**: Invaded IVC below diaphragm
	- **IIIC**: Invaded IVC above diaphragm
- Beyond Gerota's fascia: **IV**
