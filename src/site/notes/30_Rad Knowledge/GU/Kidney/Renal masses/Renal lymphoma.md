Lymphoma is the most common secondary malignant renal neoplasm (usually systemic [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma\|NHL]]).

## Imaging (CT)
- Often infiltrative and moulding → tends to preserve renal contour (“bean shape”).
- Typical patterns:
	- Multiple bilateral, homogeneous hypoenhancing renal masses (common).
	- Diffuse infiltration/nephromegaly.
	- Perirenal soft-tissue rind ± renal sinus involvement.
	- Direct extension from bulky retroperitoneal nodes encasing vessels/collecting system.
- Look for supportive disease: retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy ± splenic involvement.
- Less commonly presents as a solitary renal mass → can mimic [[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal masses/Renal cell carcinoma\|RCC]]/metastasis.
