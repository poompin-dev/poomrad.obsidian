## Overview
**Developmental cystic disorder** of the **renal medulla** characterised by **ectatic distal collecting ducts** in the papillary region → **stasis, crystal precipitation, [[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal calcification/Nephrocalcinosis\|nephrocalcinosis]] and nephrolithiasis**.  
Classically an **adult-onset**, often **incidental** finding in **young–middle-aged adults**, usually **sporadic** (rare autosomal dominant familial cases reported).  
Kidneys are usually **normal sized** and overall renal function is often **preserved**.

> [!summary]
> Think **“stone-forming adult with medullary duct ectasia”** – recurrent calcium stones, [[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal calcification/Medullary nephrocalcinosis\|medullary nephrocalcinosis]], normal-sized kidneys, and often incidental CTU/US/IVU finding.
## Associations
- Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS)
- Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (BWS)
- HNF1B-related disease (MODY 5)
- Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
- Caroli disease
- Gitelman syndrome
- Bartter syndrome
- Fabry disease
## Clinical Features
Often **asymptomatic**; when symptomatic, usually in **young–middle-aged adults**:
- Recurrent **nephrolithiasis** (calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate)
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal calcification/Nephrocalcinosis\|Nephrocalcinosis]]**
- Microscopic or gross **haematuria**
- Recurrent **UTIs**
- Flank pain / renal colic
- May have **incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA)**

## Imaging

### CT Urography
- Best current test to **demonstrate duct ectasia**.
- **“Paintbrush”** or **“Swiss cheese”** appearance from contrast-filled, dilated collecting ducts in the medulla.
- Can show **medullary nephrocalcinosis** and associated stones.
- See also: **[[70_Glossary/White pyramid sign (kidney)\|White pyramid sign (kidney)]]**.
### Ultrasound
- May show **hyperechoic medullary pyramids**, with or without visible [[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal calcification/Medullary nephrocalcinosis\|medullary nephrocalcinosis]].
- Kidneys typically **normal in size and contour**.
### Intravenous Pyelography / Retrograde Pyelography (historical)
- Classical but now rarely performed.
- **“Bouquet of flowers”** and **“paintbrush”** appearances of opacified ectatic collecting ducts.
