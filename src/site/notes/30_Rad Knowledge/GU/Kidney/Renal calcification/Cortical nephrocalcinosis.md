> [!summary]
> **Rare pattern of nephrocalcinosis with calcium deposited in the renal cortex, almost always signalling severe and often irreversible cortical injury.**

## Concept
- Pathologic **calcium deposition confined to the renal cortex**, in contrast to **medullary nephrocalcinosis** (pyramids/medulla).
- Radiologic **sign**, not a diagnosis → usually reflects **ischaemia / necrosis / advanced CKD**.

---
## Major causes

1. **Acute renal cortical necrosis**
	- Severe **shock / sepsis**  
	- **Obstetric catastrophes**: abruptio placentae, eclampsia, septic abortion, PPH  
	- **Thrombotic microangiopathy**: HUS, DIC  
	→ Global cortical ischaemia → necrosis → dystrophic calcification.

2. **Chronic cortical scarring / end-stage kidneys**
	- Long-standing **glomerulonephritis** or other causes of ESRD  
	- **Chronic renal transplant rejection** / chronic allograft nephropathy  
	→ Small, shrunken kidneys with irregular cortical calcification.

3. **Infectious / congenital**
	- **Renal TB** with cortical destruction  
	- **Congenital / perinatal insults**: intra-uterine infections (e.g. CMV, toxoplasmosis), severe perinatal asphyxia.

> [!caution]
> Classic metabolic hypercalcaemia (primary hyperparathyroidism, RTA, etc.) mainly causes **medullary** nephrocalcinosis; cortical involvement is not the typical exam association.

## Imaging features

- **Ultrasound**
	- **Echogenic renal cortex** with or without acoustic shadowing.
	- Medulla may be relatively spared → helps distinguish from medullary nephrocalcinosis.

- **CT**
	- **Thin peripheral “rim” or “tram-line” cortical calcification** in cortical necrosis.  
	- Alternatively **patchy / plaque-like cortical calcifications** in chronic scarring or TB.
	- Kidneys often **small and atrophic** in chronic disease.

- **Plain film (KUB)**
	- If extensive: faint **peripheral rim** or irregular cortical calcification over renal outlines.

## Differentials (pattern-based)
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal calcification/Medullary nephrocalcinosis\|Medullary nephrocalcinosis]]** → calcified pyramids, sparing cortex.
- **Multiple renal calculi** → usually follow collecting system rather than uniform cortical outline.
- **Calcified renal scars / infarcts** → more focal than the global cortical pattern of classic cortical necrosis.
