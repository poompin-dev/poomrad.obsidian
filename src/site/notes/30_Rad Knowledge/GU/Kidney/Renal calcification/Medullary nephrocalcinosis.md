Non-specific **radiologic pattern** of **calcium deposition in the renal medulla/pyramids**, usually **bilateral**, from various metabolic or structural causes. Think **“medullary calcium = systemic or tubule problem”**, not a single disease.

> [!summary]
> Key exam triad for **medullary nephrocalcinosis**:  
> **Primary hyperparathyroidism + distal (type 1) RTA + [[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal calcification/Medullary sponge kidney\|medullary sponge kidney]].**

## Aetiology

### 1. Hypercalcaemic / metabolic causes
- **Primary hyperparathyroidism**
- **Vitamin D excess**, milk–alkali syndrome
- **Sarcoidosis** and other granulomatous disease
- Prolonged **immobilisation**
- Other causes of chronic **hypercalcaemia / hypercalciuria**

### 2. Normal-calcium hypercalciuria / tubular causes
- **Distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis**  ← very high yield
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal calcification/Medullary sponge kidney\|Medullary sponge kidney]]**
- **Inherited tubulopathies**  
	- Bartter syndrome  
	- Gitelman (less classic but often listed)
- **Loop diuretics** aka furosemide (especially in neonates/infants)
- **Primary hyperoxaluria**, enteric hyperoxaluria

### 3. Papillary / medullary damage
Chronic insults that **injure the papillae** → papillary necrosis + dystrophic calcification:
- **Analgesic nephropathy** (NSAIDs, phenacetin)
- **Sickle cell disease/trait**
- **Diabetic nephropathy**
- **Obstructive uropathy** (stones, reflux, chronic obstruction)
- **Chronic pyelonephritis**
- **Renal TB**

## Clinical features
- Often **asymptomatic** – found on imaging for stones or renal workup.
- Symptoms derive from the **underlying cause** and associated **stones**:
	- **Nephrolithiasis**, renal colic
	- **Polyuria/polydipsia** (tubulopathy, RTA, hypercalcaemia)
	- **Microscopic or gross haematuria**
	- **Recurrent UTIs**
	- Gradual **renal dysfunction** in long-standing or severe disease

## Imaging

### Ultrasound
- **Hyperechoic medullary pyramids** due to calcium deposition.
- May or may not have posterior acoustic shadowing (depends on amount/compactness of calcium).
- Cortex often relatively spared (helps distinguish from [[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal calcification/Cortical nephrocalcinosis\|cortical nephrocalcinosis]]).
### CT
- **Punctate, linear, or coarse calcifications** in the **medulla/pyramids**.
- Often **bilateral** and symmetric.
- Frequently coexists with:
	- **Nephrolithiasis**
	- Features of underlying condition (e.g. MSK pattern, papillary necrosis, obstruction).
