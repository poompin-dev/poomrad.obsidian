> Congenital **ciliopathy** due to **PKHD1 (fibrocystin)** causing **enlarged echogenic kidneys with tiny collecting-duct cysts** and **congenital hepatic fibrosis** → major cause of renal failure in infancy/childhood.

## Genetics & pathophysiology
- Inheritance: **autosomal recessive**.
- Gene: **PKHD1** (fibrocystin/polyductin) – expressed in **renal collecting ducts** and **bile ducts**.
- Key pathology:
	- Fusiform dilatation of **collecting ducts** → “microcystic” kidneys.
	- **Ductal plate malformation** in liver → congenital hepatic fibrosis ± Caroli-like changes.

## Clinical features
- Spectrum:
	- **Perinatal/infantile**: severe renal enlargement, oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, early death.
	- **Childhood/juvenile**: slower renal decline, portal hypertension from hepatic fibrosis.
- Presentation:
	- Palpable abdominal masses (enlarged kidneys).
	- Renal failure (polyuria, polydipsia, growth failure).
	- Portal HTN: splenomegaly, varices, hypersplenism.

## Imaging - kidney
- **Prenatal US**
	- **Bilaterally enlarged, uniformly echogenic kidneys**.
	- Poor corticomedullary differentiation.
	- **No discrete macrocysts**, may see oligohydramnios.
- **Postnatal US**
	- Kidneys **large, echogenic**, smooth outline.
	- **Loss of corticomedullary differentiation**.
	- May see **tiny cortical/medullary microcysts** on high-res US.
- **CT/MRI**
	- Diffusely enlarged kidneys with **fine, radially oriented microcysts**.
	- Used mainly to assess liver/biliary tree rather than kidneys alone.

## Imaging - liver
- US/MRCP:
	- **Congenital hepatic fibrosis**: coarse liver, periportal echogenicity.
	- **Dilated intrahepatic bile ducts** (Caroli-like changes).
	- Stigmata of portal HTN: splenomegaly, collaterals.

> Think **ARPKD** in a neonate with **oligohydramnios, huge echogenic kidneys, respiratory distress**, and later **portal hypertension** from **congenital hepatic fibrosis**.
