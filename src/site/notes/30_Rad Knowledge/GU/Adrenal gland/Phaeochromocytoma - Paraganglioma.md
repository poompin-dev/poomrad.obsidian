> [!important] Pearls
> On imaging: **T2 very bright (“light-bulb”)**, **avid enhancement**, may be **cystic/haemorrhagic**. **Never biopsy** until **biochemistry excludes** a phaeo. Pre-op: **α-blockade first**, volume expansion; add **β-blocker** only after α-blockade.

- Adrenal (phaeo) – usually functional.
- Extra-adrenal **sympathetic** PG – often functional.
- Extra-adrenal [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Head and neck/Paragangliomas of the head and neck\|parasympathetic (H&N) PG ]]– usually **non-functional**, also often less dramatic T2 light-bulb sign.
- Old ‘rule of 10s’ (≈10% bilateral, ≈10% extra-adrenal, ≈10% malignant, ≈10% in children) is **outdated but still pops up in exams** – now we know **~30–40%+ hereditary**.”
## Clinical significance
- Crisis risk with procedures/anaesthesia; potentially curable cause of hypertension.
- A substantial fraction are hereditary (e.g., **RET/MEN2, [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/Von Hippel-Lindau (overview)\|VHL]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/Neurofibromatosis type 1\|NF1]], SDHx**); genetics affects surveillance and family screening
- Histology **cannot reliably distinguish benign vs malignant**; malignancy defined by **metastases** (nodes, bone, lung, liver).  
	Risk higher in: extra-adrenal, large size, **SDHB** mutation.

## Imaging pearls
### CT
- Solid, usually **>10 HU** in non-contrast phase, **strongly enhancing** mass; may be heterogeneous with haemorrhage/cystic change.
- Non-diagnostic to rely on **washout CT**; phaeos can show brisk “washout” → **do not use** washout to exclude phaeo.
### MRI
- **T2 very hyperintense** ("light-bulb sign")
	- More typical of **larger adrenal / sympathetic lesions**.
	- Small or fibrotic tumours may be only mildly T2 bright.
- **T1 variable** (blood products ↑T1).
- **Avid enhancement**; restricted diffusion on **DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging)** is common.
- **Chemical-shift imaging (CSI)**: typically **no signal drop** (distinguishes from intracellular-lipid adenoma). Rare lipid-containing phaeos exist → correlate with labs.
### Nuclear medicine
- **MIBG** scintigraphy/SPECT: catecholamine-specific.
  Classically for adrenal phaeo and some sympathetic PG; **less sensitive in SDHB / aggressive disease**.
- **FDG PET**: especially good for **SDHB-mutant / metastatic** PPGL.
- **DOTATATE PET**: great for **paragangliomas** and for planning **PRRT**.
___
## Differential diagnosis
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Adrenal gland/Adrenal adenoma\|Adrenal adenoma]]** 
	- CSI signal drop OR
	- Unenhanced HU ≤10  
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Adrenal gland/Adrenocortical carcinoma\|Adrenocortical carcinoma]]**
	- Giant, irregular, invasive, necrotic; variable enhancement
	- Especially if hormone excess is cortisol/androgen rather than catecholamine phenotype.
- **Metastasis**
	- Oncology history
	- Variable appearance, often less T2 bright 
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Adrenal gland/Myelolipoma (of the adrenal gland)\|Myelolipoma]] with haemorrhage**
	- Macroscopic fat foci  
- **Adrenal cyst/pseudocyst**
	- No internal enhancement; T2 bright, T1 dark unless blood).
___
## Management pearls
### First-line workup
- **Plasma free or urinary fractionated metanephrines** (most sensitive screening).
- Borderline results → consider **clonidine suppression test** (per endocrine protocol).
### Safety & biopsy

> [!danger] Do not biopsy an adrenal mass until phaeochromocytoma is excluded
> Needle manipulation can trigger **catecholamine crisis** (hypertensive emergency, arrhythmia, pulmonary oedema, intracranial haemorrhage). If tissue is essential (e.g., staging with known cancer), do **biochemical testing first** and proceed only after **α-blockade** with full monitoring.
### Pre-operative optimisation
- **α-blockade** **before** any β-blocker typically for **7–14 days** pre-op.
- Liberal **salt and fluid** intake to restore intravascular volume.
- Add short-acting **β-blocker** **after** adequate α-blockade for tachyarrhythmia.
- Anaesthesia: arterial line, vasodilators and magnesium available.
### Post-op / follow-up
- Monitor for **hypotension** and **hypoglycaemia** immediately post-resection.
- Repeat **metanephrines** for biochemical cure; interval imaging if hereditary or metastatic risk.
### Genetics workup
High hereditary yield; consider **genetic counselling/testing** (e.g., **RET, [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/Von Hippel-Lindau (overview)\|VHL]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/Neurofibromatosis type 1\|NF1]], SDHB/SDHD**), especially if young, bilateral, extra-adrenal, multifocal, or metastatic.
- **SDHB** → higher metastatic risk, often extra-adrenal trunk disease → **favour FDG/DOTATATE over MIBG**.
- **SDHD / SDHAF2** → multiple **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Head and neck/Paragangliomas of the head and neck\|head & neck PG]]**
____
## Potential pitfalls
- **Cystic phaeos** can mimic a “simple cyst”—look for enhancing mural nodules/septa.
- **Brisk washout** does **not** rule out phaeo.  
- Rare **lipid-containing phaeos** can show partial CSI drop—**labs decide**.  
- Small extra-adrenal paragangliomas along sympathetic chain can be missed without careful search or functional imaging.
- Head & neck paragangliomas are often **non-functional** – normal catecholamines do **not** exclude PG here. Use **somatostatin-receptor imaging** if multifocal disease suspected.
