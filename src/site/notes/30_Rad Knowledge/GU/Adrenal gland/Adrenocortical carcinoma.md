> [!summary] Core idea
Aggressive primary adrenal cortical malignancy, often large, heterogeneous, and frequently functioning (cortisol/androgen excess).

## Demographics & Risks
- Bimodal: **children <5 yrs** and **adults ~40–50 yrs**.  
- Most cases **are sporadic**; <10% syndromic.
- Syndromes with increased risk:
	- **Li–Fraumeni (TP53)** – highest-yield association  
	- **Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome**  
	- **MEN1**  
	- **APC-related / FAP (incl. Gardner variant)**  
	- **Carney complex**

## Clinical features
- ~60% **functioning** tumours →  
	- **Cushing’s** (most common)  
	- **Virilisation** (androgen excess)  
	- Mixed cortisol/androgen excess  
- Rapid-onset endocrine syndrome + large adrenal mass → think **ACC until proven otherwise**.
___
## Imaging Features
### CT/MRI
- **Large heterogeneous adrenal mass** (often **>6 cm**, big fucking angry mass) at the time of presentation.  
- **Central necrosis / haemorrhage**, irregular margins; may contain coarse calcification.  
- **Lipid-poor**: high non-contrast attenuation; **low washout**, unlike benign adenoma.  
- **Local invasion** of adjacent organs possible.  
- **Vascular invasion**: renal vein and **IVC tumour thrombus** are classic.  
- **Lymphatic metastasis** often present at diagnosis.
### Functional Imaging
- **FDG PET**: typically very avid.  
- **Metastatic pattern**: lung, liver, nodes.
___
## Differentials
For giant adrenal mass
- **Adrenal metastasis**
	- Usually bilateral
	- History of known primary.  
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Adrenal gland/Phaeochromocytoma - Paraganglioma\|Phaeochromocytoma]]**
	- More avid enhancement
	- “Lightbulb” T2, may be cystic/haemorrhagic
	- Often functioning with catecholamine symptoms.  
- **Adrenal lymphoma**
	- Homogeneous soft-tissue mass, little necrosis.
	- Often bilateral.
