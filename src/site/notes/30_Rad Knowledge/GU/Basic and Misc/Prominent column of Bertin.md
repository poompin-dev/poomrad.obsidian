- Normal anatomical variant: hypertrophied cortical tissue extending between pyramids into the renal sinus ([[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Variant anatomy/Persistent fetal lobulation\|Persistent fetal lobulation]] pattern).
- Can indent or splay the renal sinus, often at the junction of upper and mid pole; usually continuous with cortex in all planes.
- Isoechoic/isodense to cortex, normal enhancement; no cortical bulge externally.
- Key exam angle: distinguished from a mass by continuity with cortex, normal corticomedullary differentiation, and lack of calyceal distortion/destruction.
