## Definition:  
  - The energy deposited per unit mass of any medium (air, tissue, water) by ionizing radiation.  
  - Represents the physical energy imparted to the material.
## Unit:  
  - Gray (Gy) = joules per kilogram (J/kg)

## Measurement/Calculation:  
  - D = (ΔE) / m, where ΔE is energy absorbed and m is mass of the medium.  
  - Measured directly in phantoms or derived from [[30_Rad Knowledge/Physics/Safety/Air kerma\|Air kerma]] with tissue conversion factors (e.g., f-factors, mass energy absorption coefficients).
## Clinical/Protection Use:  
  - Quantifying patient dose in CT (CTDI_vol), fluoroscopy (DAP → estimated organ dose), nuclear medicine (organ doses), and external beam therapy (tumor dose).  
  - Used to predict [[30_Rad Knowledge/Physics/Safety/Deterministic effects\|Deterministic effects]] (e.g., skin erythema thresholds) and for treatment planning in radiotherapy.
