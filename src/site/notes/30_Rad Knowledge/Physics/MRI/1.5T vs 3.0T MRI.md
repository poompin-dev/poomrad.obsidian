| **Feature**                        | **1.5 Tesla**                                                | **3.0 Tesla**                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost**                           | Lower cost                                                   | Higher cost                                                                                                                       |
| **SNR**                            | Moderate SNR; sufficient for routine imaging                 | ~2x SNR vs 1.5T; can also use this higher SNR for higher spatial resolution or faster scan time, enabling advanced sequences.     |
| **Field Homogeneity**              | More forgiving B0 field                                      | Harder to keep homogeneous                                                                                                        |
| **Susceptibility artefacts**       | Less artefacts due to less local B0 inhomogeneity            | More artefacts as susceptibility effects scale with B0 esp. near metal, more chemical shift, more B0-related artefacts in general |
| **Clinical use**                   | Preferred for cardiac, abdomen, and patient with implants    | Preferred for neuro (fMRI, perfusion, DTI), small structures (inner ear, prostate, cartilage, small nerves), dynamic MRA          |
| **Specific absorption rate (SAR)** | Cooler with fewer specific absorption rate (SAR) limitations | Potentially warmer due to higher SAR (~4x SAR vs 1.5T); more SAR limitations, especially for longer scans                         |
