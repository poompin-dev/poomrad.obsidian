| Names        | CHESS, SPAIR/SPIR                                                                                              | STIR                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Dixon, mDIXON, IDEAL                                                                             |
| Principle    | Frequency-selective RF pulse hits fat peak to dephase fat (CHESS); or null the fat (SPAIR/SPIR)                | Non-selective inversion pulse → wait until fat signal is null (TI time) then RF → No transverse fat signal                                                                                                       | Phase separation of water and fat using multiple echo times then recombine mathematically        |
| Pros         | High SNR, Preserves T1, T2 contrast                                                                            | Most robust to [[30_Rad Knowledge/Physics/MRI/Artefacts/Off-resonance\|Off-resonance]], can be used in large FOV and near metal                                                                                                                                        | Uniform FS over big FOV, multiple sequences from one acquisition, good SNR                       |
| Cons         | Very sensitive to off-resonance; Patchy fat suppression due to unavoidable B0 inhomogeneity in large FOV       | lower SNR → typically poorer spatial resolution due to thicker slices and longer TE needed to compensate low SNR; Kills all short T1 signals including Gd enhancement (cannot be used in post-contrast imaging). | Sensitive to off-resonance → water-fat swaps, ugly artefact near strong inhomogeneity            |
| Applications | Workhorse of joint imaging (better cartilage signal than STIR); Good for pre/post contrast study (unlike STIR) | Robust imaging in off-resonance zones (hand, foot, spine, whole body, metal)                                                                                                                                     | Pretty and fast large FOV imaging when B0 is ok (whole body, spine); if fail → step back to STIR |
