> [!summary] Key Concept
> BPE refers to the normal enhancement of fibroglandular tissue on contrast-enhanced MRI.
> * It is distinct from the *amount* of fibroglandular tissue (density).
> * **Significance:** High BPE can **mask** lesions (reduce sensitivity) and increase false positives.
> * **Risk Factor:** Emerging evidence suggests high BPE is an independent risk factor for future breast cancer.

## 1. Definition & Assessment
* **What is it?** Enhancement of normal breast stroma/glandular tissue after Gadolinium administration.
* **Phase:** Best assessed on the **first post-contrast** subtraction image.
* **Pattern:** Typically diffuse and bilateral.
* **Terminology:** We describe both the **Level** (intensity/volume) and **Symmetry**.

## 2. BI-RADS Categories (Qualitative)
The ACR BI-RADS lexicon categorises BPE into four levels. This must be reported in every breast MRI.
1.  **Minimal:** Almost no enhancement (<25% of glandular tissue enhances).
    * *Implication:* Excellent sensitivity for detecting small lesions.
2.  **Mild:** Little enhancement (25–50%).
    * *Implication:* Minimal interference with interpretation.
3.  **Moderate:** Considerable enhancement (50–75%).
    * *Implication:* Can obscure small masses; consider mentioning "possible masking" in the report.
4.  **Marked:** Intense enhancement (>75%).
    * *Implication:* **Significant reduction in sensitivity.** "Ghosting" on subtraction images can be problematic.

## 3. Factors Influencing BPE
BPE is highly hormonally sensitive.
### Physiological
* **Menstrual Cycle:** BPE peaks in week 1 and 4.
    * **Golden Window:** Scan between **Day 7–14** (follicular phase) when BPE is lowest.
* **Lactation:** Marked BPE is typical (makes screening lactating women very difficult).
* **Age:** Decreases with age and menopause.
### Iatrogenic
* **HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy):** Increases BPE.
    * *Tip:* Cessation of HRT for 4–6 weeks prior to MRI can reduce BPE (though rarely practical).
* **Tamoxifen / Aromatase Inhibitors:** Decrease BPE.
    * *Note:* A lack of BPE reduction after starting Tamoxifen may predict poor treatment response.
* **Radiation Therapy:** Decreases BPE in the treated breast (can lead to asymmetry).

## 4. Asymmetric BPE

> [!warning] Red Flag
> BPE should be **symmetric**. Asymmetric BPE is suspicious.

* **Causes of Asymmetry:**
    * **Pathological:** Large region of non-mass enhancement (DCIS, Lobular CA).
    * **Previous Radiation:** Reduced BPE on the treated side (the "normal" looking side might actually be the suppressed side).
    * **Mastectomy:** Obviously no BPE.
* **Action:** If no history of radiation/surgery, asymmetric BPE requires careful scrutiny to rule out diffuse malignancy.

## 5. Reporting Tips
* **Don't confuse Density with BPE:** A patient can have "Extremely Dense" breasts (on mammogram) but "Minimal" BPE (on MRI). They are not correlated.
* **The "Masking" Disclaimer:** If BPE is **Marked**, it is prudent to add a caveat: *"Sensitivity for small lesions may be reduced due to marked background parenchymal enhancement."*
