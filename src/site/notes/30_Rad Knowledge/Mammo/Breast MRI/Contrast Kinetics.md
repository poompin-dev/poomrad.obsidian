> [!summary] Key Concept
> Analysis of how a lesion takes up and releases Gadolinium over time.
> * **"Wash-in" (Early Phase):** First 2 minutes. Reflects vascularity/angiogenesis.
> * **"Wash-out" (Delayed Phase):** 2–7 minutes. Reflects interstitial space/leakiness.
> 
> **Golden Rule:** Morphology trumps kinetics. A spiculated mass with a Type 1 curve is still suspicious.

## 1. The Kinetic Curves (Time-Intensity Curves)
The curve is generated by placing a Region of Interest (ROI) over the **most avidly enhancing** part of the lesion (avoiding necrosis/cysts).
### Type 1: Persistent (Progressive)
* **Shape:** Continual increase in signal intensity over time. No plateau or loss of signal.
* **Interpretation:** usually **Benign**.
* **PPV for Malignancy:** Low (~6%).
* **Typical Lesions:**
	* Fibroadenoma (myxoid type).
	* Normal parenchyma / PASH.
	* **Trap:** ~10% of invasive cancers show Type 1 (especially **Lobular CA** and **Mucinous CA**).
### Type 2: Plateau
* **Shape:** Initial rapid rise, then flattens out (signal stays relatively constant, $\pm$ 10%).
* **Interpretation:** **Indeterminate / Suspicious**.
* **PPV for Malignancy:** Intermediate (varies widely, but often quoted ~7-28% risk).
* **Typical Lesions:**
	* Fibroadenoma (sclerotic).
	* DCIS.
	* Some invasive cancers.
### Type 3: Washout
* **Shape:** Rapid initial rise followed by a distinctive **drop** in signal intensity (>10% decrease) in the delayed phase.
* **Interpretation:** **Malignant** until proven otherwise.
* **PPV for Malignancy:** High (>29–87%).
* **Pathophysiology:** Malignant vessels are leaky (shunts) with small interstitial space $\rightarrow$ contrast enters fast and leaves fast.
* **Typical Lesions:**
	* Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC).
	* High-grade tumours.
	* **Trap:** Lymph nodes and proteinaceous cysts can sometimes show washout-like features (but T2 signal helps differentiate).

## 2. Assessment Strategy

### Step 1: Qualitative (Visual)
* Look at the subtraction images.
* Does it enhance?
* **Internal Enhancement Patterns:**
	* **Homogeneous:** Uniform (often benign or small CA).
	* **Heterogeneous:** Variable (suspicious).
	* **Rim Enhancement:** **High PPV for malignancy** (central necrosis/fibrosis with active periphery). *Exceptions: Fat necrosis, inflamed cyst.*
	* **Dark Internal Septations:** Highly specific for **Fibroadenoma**.

### Step 2: Quantitative (The Curve)
* Place a **small ROI** on the "hot spot" (fastest enhancing area).
* **Do not** include the whole tumour (averaging dilutes the washout).
* **Do not** include necrosis (no enhancement).

## 3. Important Caveats (The "Exam Traps")

> [!danger] Morphology > Kinetics
> A **Type 3 (Washout)** curve in a smooth, oval mass with dark internal septations is likely a **Fibroadenoma**.
> A **Type 1 (Persistent)** curve in a spiculated, architectural distortion is likely **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)**.
> *Never downgrade a morphologically suspicious lesion based on a benign curve.*

### False Negatives (Malignancy with "Benign" Kinetics)
* **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC):** Often diffuses gently; Type 1 or 2 curve common.
* **Mucinous Carcinoma:** Large interstitial space holds contrast; Type 1 (persistent) curve is classic.
* **DCIS:** Often shows plateau or even persistent enhancement (non-mass enhancement).

### False Positives (Benign with "Malignant" Kinetics)
* **Lymph Nodes:** Intense washout is normal for nodes (look for the hilum).
* **Inflammation/Mastitis:** Hypervascularity can mimic washout.
* **Fibroadenoma:** Cellular/young FA can sometimes show washout (though plateau is more common).

## 4. Reporting Terminology (BI-RADS)
* **Initial Phase (first 2 mins):**
	* Slow
	* Medium
	* Rapid
* **Delayed Phase (after 2 mins):**
	* Persistent
	* Plateau
	* Washout

**Example Dictation:**
*"The mass demonstrates rapid initial enhancement with delayed washout (Type 3 kinetics), concerning for malignancy."*
