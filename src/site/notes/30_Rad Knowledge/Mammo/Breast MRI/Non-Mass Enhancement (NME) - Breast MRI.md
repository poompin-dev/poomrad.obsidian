> [!summary] Key Concept
> Enhancement that is neither a "Mass" (space-occupying lesion with convex borders) nor a "Focus" (tiny dot <5mm).
> * **The Challenge:** Distinguishing NME from Background Parenchymal Enhancement (BPE).
> * **The Rule:** If it is distinct from the surrounding BPE, asymmetric, or follows a specific anatomical pattern, it is NME.
> * **Main Suspects:** **DCIS** (classic), **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)**, and inflammatory conditions.

## 1. Distribution (Where is it?)
*Describes how the enhancement is spread through the breast volume.*
### High Suspicion Patterns
* **Linear:** Enhancement arranged in a line.
	* *Significance:* Suggests ductal spread.
	* *Differential:* DCIS, Thrombosed vein (usually doesn't enhance, look at T1 pre).
* **Segmental:** Triangular shape with the apex pointing towards the nipple.
	* *Significance:* **Most suspicious distribution**. Suggests a process filling a ductal system/lobe.
	* *Differential:* **DCIS**, high-risk lesions.
### Lower Suspicion / Indeterminate Patterns
* **Focal:** Small area (<25% of a quadrant) but larger than a focus.
* **Regional:** Large area (>25% of a quadrant) not fitting a ductal distribution.
	* *Differential:* Mastitis, trauma, PASH, but also ILC.
* **Multiple Regions:** Patchy areas in at least two quadrants.
	* *Likely:* BPE or Fibrocystic change.
* **Diffuse:** Distributed randomly throughout the whole breast.
	* *Likely:* BPE (if bilateral), Mastitis (if unilateral).

## 2. Internal Enhancement Patterns (What does it look like?)
*Describes the texture of the enhancement.*
### The "Evil" Patterns (High PPV)
* **Clustered Ring:** Tiny rings of enhancement grouped together.
	* *Pathology:* Periductal enhancement around necrosis or tumour cells within ducts.
	* *PPV:* **Very High (~63–87%)** for DCIS or ID.
* **Clumped:** "Cobblestone" or "Bunch of Grapes" appearance.
	* *Pathology:* Ductal filling.
	* *PPV:* High (~40–60%) for DCIS.
### The "Equivocal" Patterns
* **Heterogeneous:** Irregular, non-uniform.
	* *Context:* Suspicious if in a linear/segmental distribution. Benign if regional/diffuse (fibrocystic change).
* **Homogeneous:** Uniform, confluent enhancement.
	* *Context:* Rare for cancer (unless treated). Often benign sclerosis or hormonal effect.
* **Stippled / Punctate:** "Sand-like" or "Powdery".
	* *Context:* Often benign fibrocystic change, but can be low-grade DCIS.

## 3. Kinetic Curves in NME

> [!warning] Kinetics are less reliable in NME
> Unlike masses, NME contains a mix of normal tissue and pathology.
> * **Washout (Type 3)** is helpful if present (suggests malignancy).
> * **Persistent (Type 1)** or **Plateau (Type 2)** are very common in DCIS and ILC. **Do not dismiss NME based on "benign" kinetics.**

## 4. Differential Diagnosis Strategies

### NME vs. BPE (The Daily Struggle)
| Feature | Suggests NME (Pathology) | Suggests BPE (Physiological) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Symmetry** | Asymmetric / Unilateral | Bilateral / Symmetric |
| **Shape** | Segmental (Triangular) / Linear | Regional / Diffuse |
| **Temporal** | Stable or Worsening | Fluctuates with cycle |
| **T2 Signal** | Variable | Often T2 Hyperintense |
### DCIS vs. Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)
* **DCIS:**
	* *Classic Look:* **Clumped** or **Clustered Ring** enhancement in a **Segmental** or **Linear** distribution.
	* *Calcification:* Often correlates with mammographic calcs (but MRI sees the non-calcified extent).
* **ILC (The Stealth Killer):**
	* *Classic Look:* **Regional** or **Diffuse** enhancement. Often **Heterogeneous**.
	* *Kinetics:* Frequently Type 1 or 2 (low angiogenesis).
	* *Key:* Look for "architectural distortion" on T1 pre-contrast or "shrinking breast" phenomenon.

## 5. Reporting Checklist (BI-RADS)
When you see NME, your report **must** state:
1.  **Distribution:** (e.g., Segmental).
2.  **Internal Pattern:** (e.g., Clumped).
3.  **Kinetics:** (e.g., Plateau).
4.  **Correlate:** Is there a corresponding mammographic density or calcification?

**Dictation Example:**
*"There is non-mass enhancement in the upper outer quadrant spanning 4 cm in a segmental distribution. Internal enhancement characteristics are clumped. Kinetic assessment demonstrates plateau phase. This is suspicious for DCIS (BI-RADS 4)."*
