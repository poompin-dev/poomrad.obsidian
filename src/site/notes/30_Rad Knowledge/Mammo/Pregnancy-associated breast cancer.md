Pregnancy-associated breast cancer = breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or within about 1 year after delivery

**Key concept**: *same disease biology, but diagnosed in a hormonally chaotic, medico-legal minefield*.

## Epidemiology & biology

- Roughly 1 in 3,000 pregnancies; one of the commonest pregnancy-related malignancies.  
- Tends to present later: “it’s just pregnancy/lactation change” → delayed referral.  
- Often higher stage at diagnosis, more nodal disease, and more **often high-grade, hormone-receptor negative and HER2-positive / triple-negative** than age-matched controls.  
- Postpartum cancers (within a few years after delivery) may have particularly aggressive biology, possibly related to involution-associated remodelling.

## Clinical presentation
- New palpable mass is the classic story.  
- Can also present with focal asymmetry, skin/nipple changes, bloody discharge.  
- Key principle: **any persistent palpable mass in pregnancy or lactation must be imaged**; do *not* “watch and wait”.
___
## Imaging approach
### Ultrasound (first line)
  - No radiation; excellent for dense, hormonally stimulated breasts.  
  - Typical findings: irregular hypoechoic mass, angular/spiculated margins, posterior shadowing, possibly abnormal nodes.
### Mammography
  - Safe in pregnancy with abdominal shielding; foetal dose is tiny and well below harmful levels.  
  - High background density but still useful for calcifications, architectural distortion and multifocality.
### MRI
  - Gadolinium generally avoided during pregnancy (crosses placenta).  
  - Postpartum/lactating MRI is possible but background enhancement is often very high; interpret carefully.  
  - DWI can help when contrast is undesirable.
___
## Management
- Multidisciplinary planning is mandatory.  
- Surgery (mastectomy or breast-conserving) is feasible in all trimesters; radiotherapy is deferred until after delivery.  
- Systemic therapy can be given in 2nd/3rd trimester (no chemo 1st trimester; no trastuzumab or endocrine therapy during pregnancy).  
- Sentinel node biopsy with Tc-99m alone is increasingly accepted as safe; blue dye is relatively contraindicated.
