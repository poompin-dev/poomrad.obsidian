## Overview
- Congenital cystic dilatation of intra/extrahepatic bile ducts.
- Strong female and East Asian predominance; often presents in childhood, but many adults now picked up on imaging.

> [!summary]
> Think “abnormal cystic/fusiform ductal dilatation that *communicates* with the biliary tree + ↑ malignancy risk”.

## Pathogenesis & Clinical
- Often associated with abnormal pancreatobiliary junction → pancreatic reflux into CBD → inflammation, weakness, dilatation.
- Classic (but uncommon) triad: RUQ pain + jaundice + palpable mass.
- Adults: recurrent cholangitis, pancreatitis, stones, or incidental on US/CT/MR.

## Imaging
- **US**: cystic structure in porta hepatis continuous with CBD; look for intrahepatic duct (IHD) dilatation, stones, sludge.
- **CT/MR**: well-defined fluid lesion following bile; exclude hepatic cyst/pseudocyst/duodenal diverticulum.
- **MRCP** (exam favourite): best non-invasive anatomy + classification; shows communication with ducts and pancreaticobiliary junction.

## Todani Classification
1. **Type I** – Isolated extrahepatic duct dilatation (most common)  
	- IA: cystic; IB: segmental; IC: fusiform.
2. **Type II** – Saccular diverticulum of CBD.
3. **Type III** – Choledochocele (intraluminal cystic dilatation in duodenal wall).
4. **Type IV**  
	- IVa: multiple extrahepatic + intrahepatic cysts.  
	- IVb: multiple extrahepatic cysts only.
5. **Type V** – Caroli disease (intrahepatic only; “central dot sign”).  
	- With congenital hepatic fibrosis → Caroli **syndrome**.

## Exam / Management Angle

> [!Caution]
> Markedly ↑ risk of cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma, especially Types I, IV and V; risk persists after drainage-alone surgery.

- Definitive treatment is complete cyst excision with biliary-enteric reconstruction
	- Liver resection or transplant for advanced Caroli disease.
- Key differentials for porta hepatis cystic lesion: 
	- pancreatic pseudocyst
	- duodenal diverticulum
	- hepatic cyst
	- gallbladder duplication
	MRCP helps by showing ductal communication pattern.
