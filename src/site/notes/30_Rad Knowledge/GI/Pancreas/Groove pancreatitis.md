## Overview
- Rare focal form of chronic pancreatitis centred in the pancreaticoduodenal groove (space between pancreatic head, duodenum, and common bile duct)
- Characterised by fibrotic scarring ± cystic change in groove or duodenal wall
- Two forms:
  - Pure: confined to groove
  - Segmental: involves groove and adjacent pancreatic head
- Strong association with alcohol abuse and smoking
- Frequently mimics pancreatic head ductal adenocarcinoma

## Epidemiology
- Predominantly middle-aged males (40–60 years)
- Heavy alcohol consumption almost universal risk factor
- Rare overall, but increasingly recognised on imaging

## Key radiological manifestations

### CT (modality of choice)
- Ill-defined sheet-like soft-tissue mass or fibrosis in pancreaticoduodenal groove
- Poorly enhancing relative to normal pancreas
- Cystic foci within groove or duodenal wall (highly characteristic)
- Duodenal wall thickening with luminal narrowing/stenosis
- Smooth tapering of intrapancreatic common bile duct (no abrupt cutoff)
- Minimal or no upstream pancreatic duct dilatation
- Delayed venous phase: gradual enhancement of fibrotic tissue

### MRI
- T1WI: hypointense sheet-like tissue in groove
- T2WI: variable – cysts hyperintense, fibrosis hypointense
- Post-contrast: delayed enhancement similar to CT
- MRCP: tapered narrowing of distal CBD and main pancreatic duct without significant upstream dilatation

### Endoscopic ultrasound
- Useful adjunct: hypoechoic groove mass, cysts in thickened duodenal wall

> Sheet-like groove fibrosis + cysts in duodenal wall/medial aspect + duodenal stenosis → virtually pathognomonic for groove pancreatitis.

## Differential diagnosis

| Diagnosis                            | Key differentiators                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma     | Discrete mass, abrupt duct cutoff, upstream dilatation >5 mm, vascular invasion, metastases |
| [[30_Rad Knowledge/GI/Pancreas/Autoimmune pancreatitis\|Autoimmune pancreatitis]]          | Sausage-shaped pancreas, capsule-like rim, multifocal IgG4 disease, steroid response        |
| Acute pancreatitis                   | Peripancreatic fluid/stranding, clinical acute onset                                        |
| Duodenal carcinoma                   | Primary duodenal mass, mucosal irregularity, lymphadenopathy                                |
| Paraduodenal fibrosis (other causes) | No cysts in duodenal wall, different clinical context                                       |

> [!warning] Common pitfall
> Segmental form with head involvement often mistaken for carcinoma → leads to unnecessary Whipple resection. Look carefully for duodenal wall cysts and absence of abrupt duct obstruction.

## Imaging approach
- Initial: multiphase contrast-enhanced CT (arterial + pancreatic + venous phases)
- Equivocal cases → MRI with MRCP for better soft-tissue and duct characterisation
- EUS ± biopsy if carcinoma cannot be excluded (histology shows Brunner gland hyperplasia, fibrosis, cysts)
- Follow-up: conservative management (alcohol cessation) often leads to stabilisation or improvement

## Pearls
- Cystic change within thickened medial duodenal wall or groove is the most specific finding
- Absence of vascular encasement and metastases favours groove pancreatitis over malignancy
- Smooth tapering of CBD and pancreatic duct without marked upstream dilatation strongly against carcinoma
- Alcohol history + male patient + groove-centred findings → think groove pancreatitis first
- Pure form rarely causes significant head mass effect

> [!note] Reporting tip
> Suggest "features consistent with groove pancreatitis (sheet-like fibrosis with duodenal wall cysts and smooth distal CBD tapering); clinical correlation and consider EUS to exclude malignancy."
