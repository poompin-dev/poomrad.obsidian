## Overview
- Premalignant mucin-producing epithelial neoplasm arising from main pancreatic duct or branch ducts
- Classified by involvement:
	- Main-duct (MD-IPMN): highest malignant potential
	- Branch-duct (BD-IPMN): lower risk, often multifocal
	- Mixed-type: combines both
- Communication with pancreatic duct is hallmark (distinguishes from other cystic neoplasms)
- Risk stratification based on high-risk stigmata and worrisome features (Fukuoka guidelines)
- Management ranges from surveillance to resection depending on risk

## Epidemiology
- Increasing incidence due to improved imaging (often incidental)
- Mean age at diagnosis 60–70 years
- Slight male predominance
- BD-IPMN more common than MD-IPMN
- Association with extrapancreatic malignancies slightly increased
___
## Key radiological manifestations

### MRI/MRCP (modality of choice)
- BD-IPMN: pleomorphic cystic lesion(s) in uncinate/head (but can occur throughout pancreas), clear ductal communication
	- Grape-like cluster or single locule
	- T2 hyperintense, thin septa
- MD-IPMN: diffuse or segmental main duct dilatation (>5 mm without obstruction)
- Mixed: combination of above
- Mural nodules: enhancing on post-contrast T1 (key for malignancy risk)
- Mucin: hyperintense on T2, may cause dependent layering or filling defects

### CT
- Similar findings to MRI but poorer soft-tissue characterisation
- Useful for detecting calcification (rare) or enhancing nodules
- Multiphase protocol recommended for nodule assessment

### Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
- Highest sensitivity for mural nodules and main duct involvement
- Allows FNA for cytology/CEA/amylase (high amylase favours IPMN)

> [!tip] Diagnostic hallmark
> Direct communication with pancreatic duct on MRCP or EUS → virtually diagnostic of IPMN (vs mucinous cystic neoplasm which does not communicate).

___
## Risk stratification (Fukuoka guidelines)

### High-risk stigmata (prompt resection)
- Enhancing mural nodule ≥5 mm
- Main pancreatic duct ≥10 mm
- Obstructive jaundice with cystic lesion in pancreatic head
### Worrisome features (consider EUS ± resection)
- Cyst ≥3 cm
- Enhancing mural nodule <5 mm
- Thickened/enhancing cyst walls
- Main duct 5–9 mm
- Abrupt change in duct calibre with distal atrophy
- Lymphadenopathy
- Elevated serum CA19-9
- Rapid growth or acute pancreatitis
___
## Differential diagnosis

| Diagnosis                          | Key differentiators                                      |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN)     | No duct communication, peripheral eggshell calcification, almost exclusively female, body/tail |
| Serous cystadenoma (SCA)           | Microcystic/honeycomb, central scar/calcification, no duct communication |
| Pseudocyst                         | Clinical pancreatitis history, unilocular, thick wall, no nodules |
| Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm     | Young female, solid-cystic, haemorrhage, tail predominant |
| Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with cystic change | Solid mass with upstream dilatation, vascular invasion |

> [!warning] Common pitfall
> Small BD-IPMN often overcalled as needing resection → adhere strictly to guidelines to avoid unnecessary surgery. Many <3 cm without worrisome features are safe for surveillance.

## Imaging approach
- Initial detection: contrast-enhanced CT or MRI
- Characterisation: MRI with MRCP (thin-slice 3D heavily T2 sequences essential)
- High-risk or worrisome features → EUS ± FNA
- Surveillance:
	- Low-risk: MRI/MRCP alternating with EUS yearly initially, then lengthen if stable
	- Stop at age ~80 or limited life expectancy
- Post-resection: lifelong surveillance for multifocal disease

## Pearls
- Multifocality common in BD-IPMN → image entire pancreas
- Growth rate >5 mm/year is concerning
- Main duct involvement (even focal) dramatically increases malignancy risk
- "Field defect" concept: entire ductal epithelium at risk → new IPMN may develop elsewhere
- Gastric-type BD-IPMN lowest risk; intestinal-type higher; pancreatobiliary highest

> [!note] Reporting tip
> Clearly state type (BD/MD/mixed), size, duct communication, presence/absence of worrisome features or high-risk stigmata, and recommend management per Fukuoka guidelines (e.g., "branch-duct IPMN 2.8 cm without worrisome features; suggest MRI surveillance in 12 months").
