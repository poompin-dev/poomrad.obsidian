# Thymic carcinoma

> [!summary]
> **High-grade malignant thymic epithelial tumour**. Compared with [[30_Rad Knowledge/Chest/Mediastinum/Thymoma\|thymoma]], it more often shows **infiltrative invasion**, **nodal metastases**, and **distant spread**, so prognosis is generally worse.
## Clinical
- Usually **adults**; **very rare in children**
- Paraneoplastic syndromes (e.g. **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Paraneoplastic syndromes/Myasthenia gravis\|myasthenia gravis]]**) are **uncommon** compared with thymoma
- Often presents at **locally advanced stage**
___
## Imaging features
### CT (workhorse)
- **Large** anterior mediastinal mass
- **Irregular / infiltrative margins**
- **Heterogeneous enhancement** with **necrosis** or haemorrhage common
- **Local invasion**: pericardium, great vessels (encasement), lung, chest wall
- **Calcification** may be present (not specific)
- **Lymphadenopathy** (mediastinal ± supraclavicular) is more suggestive than in thymoma
- Look for spread: **pleural nodules/effusion**, pulmonary metastases, distant metastases
### MRI
- Helps assess **pericardial and vascular invasion** when CT equivocal
### FDG PET/CT
- Often **FDG-avid**; useful for **staging** (nodes + distant disease) and response assessment

> [!warning]
> Imaging can strongly suggest thymic carcinoma, but **histology is required** for definitive diagnosis. Report as **“aggressive thymic epithelial tumour suspicious for thymic carcinoma”** when appropriate.

___
## Features favouring thymic carcinoma over thymoma
- **Infiltrative invasion** (vascular encasement, pericardial/chest wall invasion)
- **Mediastinal/supraclavicular lymphadenopathy**
- **Pleural/pericardial disease** (nodules, effusion)
- **Distant metastases**
- More **heterogeneous**, **necrotic** mass with **irregular** margins
