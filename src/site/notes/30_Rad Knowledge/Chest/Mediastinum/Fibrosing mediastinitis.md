Rare fibroinflammatory reaction in the mediastinum that progressively encases and narrows mediastinal structures (vessels, airways). Often post-infectious (classically histoplasmosis in North America; TB can be relevant in Asia) but can be IgG4-related or idiopathic.

> Think "benign-looking fibrosis, malignant-level obstruction".
## Pearls
- Two patterns: focal calcified granulomatous (post-infectious) vs diffuse infiltrative non-calcified.
- Symptoms come from obstruction: SVC syndrome, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, recurrent pneumonia.
- Can mimic malignancy clinically and radiologically, but calcified, encasing pattern is a clue.

## Key imaging features
### CT (workhorse)
- Infiltrative, ill-defined soft tissue in mediastinum or hila, often centred on prior nodal stations.
- Dense or stippled calcifications are common in granulomatous/post-infectious type.
- Key finding is encasement/stenosis:
	- SVC and brachiocephalic veins (SVC syndrome, chest wall collaterals)
	- Pulmonary arteries/veins (pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary oedema, haemoptysis)
	- Main bronchi (airway narrowing, post-obstructive infection, lobar collapse)
- May see unilateral volume loss, perfusion asymmetry, pleural effusion.
### MRI
- Fibrotic tissue often low signal on T2 (more "burnt out" fibrosis).
- Variable enhancement; more enhancement can suggest active inflammatory component.
### FDG PET-CT
- Variable uptake: can be low in inactive fibrosis, higher if ongoing inflammation.
- Helpful mainly to exclude aggressive malignancy and guide biopsy target.

## Top differentials
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Lymphoma\|Lymphoma]]/metastatic nodes: bulky discrete nodal masses, less encasing fibrosis, calcification usually absent unless treated.
- Sarcoidosis: symmetric hilar/mediastinal nodes, perilymphatic lung nodules; fibrosis pattern differs.
- IgG4-related disease: multi-organ involvement (pancreas, salivary glands, retroperitoneum), less calcification; may respond to steroids.
- Radiation fibrosis: matches radiation field and history.
