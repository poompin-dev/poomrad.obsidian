> [!summary]
> **Benign thymic mass composed of mature fat plus thymic tissue**. Often very large and pliable, so it can **drape over the heart** and mimic **cardiomegaly** on CXR.

## Epidemiology and clinical
- Rare overall; reported around **2% to 9% of thymic tumours**
- Any age, often discovered in adults
- Frequently **asymptomatic**; symptoms are usually from **mass effect** when giant
## Associations
- Reported with **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Paraneoplastic syndromes/Myasthenia gravis\|myasthenia gravis]]** and other autoimmune phenomena, but not a reliable pairing
___
## Imaging
### CXR
- Apparent **cardiomegaly** or anterior mediastinal opacity
- Can “slump” toward the diaphragm and conform to the cardiac silhouette
### CT (most helpful)
- **Predominantly fat attenuation** anterior mediastinal mass
- **Internal soft tissue strands/nodules** representing thymic tissue
- Usually **well-defined** and non-invasive in behaviour
### MRI
- Fat signal: **high T1/T2**, suppresses on fat-sat
- Thymic soft tissue components may enhance
___
## Key differentials
- **Mediastinal lipoma**: almost pure fat, minimal soft tissue
- **Teratoma**: fat plus calcification/fluid, more mixed elements
- **Well-differentiated liposarcoma**: thicker septa, nodular non-fat soft tissue, more aggressive features
- **Prominent pericardial fat pad / Morgagni hernia**: check continuity with abdomen or typical location
