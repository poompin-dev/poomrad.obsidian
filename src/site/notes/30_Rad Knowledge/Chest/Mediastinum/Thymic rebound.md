> [!summary]
> **Benign thymic regrowth** after systemic stress (classically **post-chemotherapy**) that can mimic **anterior mediastinal relapse**.

## When it happens
- Commonest in **children and young adults** (can occur in adults)
- Triggers: **chemotherapy**, **steroid withdrawal**, major illness/surgery, radiotherapy
- Timing: often **months after treatment** (variable)
___
## Imaging features
### CXR
- **Smooth anterior mediastinal fullness**
- Usually **no aggressive mass effect**
### CT
- **Diffuse, symmetric** soft tissue in thymic bed
- Preserves **normal thymic shape** (triangular/quadrilateral), **smooth margins**
- **No invasion**: no vascular encasement, no destructive features
- Fat content can be mixed (age dependent)
### MRI
- Chemical shift: **signal drop on opposed-phase** supports **hyperplasia** (microscopic fat)
- DWI: thymus can show **restriction** even when benign, do not overcall on DWI alone
### FDG PET/CT
- **Mild to moderate**, fairly **diffuse** thymic uptake
- **Focal very intense** uptake or **new extra-thymic lesions** shifts concern to relapse

> [!warning]
> Red flags: **nodular thymus**, **progressive enlargement**, **very focal intense FDG**, or **new disease elsewhere**. In these, do not label "rebound" as definite.
