> [!summary]
> **Primary thymic epithelial neoplasm** of the **anterior mediastinum** with a spectrum from **encapsulated** to **locally invasive** and **pleural/pericardial spread**. Frequently associated with **autoimmune disease**, especially **myasthenia gravis**.

## Clinical associations
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Paraneoplastic syndromes/Myasthenia gravis\|Myasthenia gravis]]** is common
- Other classic associations:
	- **Pure red cell aplasia**
	- **Hypogammaglobulinaemia (Good syndrome)**

## Imaging features
### CXR
- **Anterior mediastinal mass** or mediastinal widening; may be subtle if small.
### CT
- Typically **well-defined**, **round/lobulated** anterior mediastinal soft tissue mass.
- Can be **heterogeneous** (cystic change, haemorrhage, necrosis).
- Calcification can occur: **capsular** or **coarse** (not specific).

**Features suspicious for invasion**
- **Irregular/lobulated margins** with **loss of clear fat planes** (suggestive, not definitive)
- **Pericardial thickening/effusion** or direct contact with deformity
- **Great vessel encasement** or clear infiltration
- **Pleural nodules/pleural thickening** (drop metastases) or pleural effusion
- Clue: **phrenic nerve palsy** (raised hemidiaphragm)
### MRI
- Useful for **local invasion** (pericardium, vessels) when CT equivocal.
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Chest/Mediastinum/Thymus chemical shift MRI\|Chemical shift]]: **lack of opposed-phase signal drop** supports tumour over [[30_Rad Knowledge/Chest/Mediastinum/Thymic rebound\|thymic hyperplasia]] (hyperplasia typically drops).
### FDG PET/CT
- Uptake is variable; more useful to look for **pleural/extrathoracic disease** or alternate diagnosis than to "grade" thymoma.
___
## Key differentials
- **Thymic rebound/hyperplasia**: preserved thymic shape, symmetric; **opposed-phase signal drop**.
- **Thymic carcinoma**: more aggressive appearance, nodes/metastases more likely.
- **Lymphoma**: bulky lobulated mass with widespread nodes, systemic context.
- **Germ cell tumour (teratoma)**: macroscopic fat, fluid, calcification, teeth-like elements.
## Zebra
- **Osseous metaplasia**: very rare; reported in case reports (often females). Can show **coarse internal calcification** and may mimic teratoma.
