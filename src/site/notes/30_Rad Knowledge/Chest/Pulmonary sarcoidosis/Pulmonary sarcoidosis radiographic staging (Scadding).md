## Overview
CXR based staging system for pulmonary sarcoidosis (Scadding).
## Stages (CXR)
- Stage 0: Normal CXR
- Stage I: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (often with right paratracheal nodes), no lung parenchymal disease
- Stage II: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy plus parenchymal disease
- Stage III: Parenchymal disease without hilar lymphadenopathy
- Stage IV: Fibrosis (architectural distortion, volume loss, traction bronchiectasis, classically upper lobe predominant)

## Differential tips
- BHL: consider lymphoma, TB, fungal infection, pneumoconiosis, metastatic nodes.
- Upper lobe fibrosis: consider TB, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pneumoconiosis.

> [!tip]
Stage is CXR based. CT often shows more extensive disease than the Scadding stage suggests.

> [!warning]
Stage is not the same as clinical severity; use symptoms, PFTs, and CT when needed.
