**CPFE** = upper-lobe predominant emphysema plus clinically significant fibrotic ILD (often UIP/IPF) with a characteristic physiology (preserved volumes but poor gas transfer) and high complication risk.
## Physiology and clinical implications
- Spirometry and lung volumes can be near-normal or only mildly abnormal.
- DLCO is often disproportionately reduced (key clue).
- Pulmonary hypertension is common and drives prognosis.
- Increased lung cancer risk compared with emphysema or fibrosis alone.
___
## Key imaging features
### Radiograph
Hyperinflation plus basal reticulation. Lung volumes may look less reduced than expected for the amount of fibrosis.
### HRCT
- Emphysema: centrilobular and/or paraseptal, classically upper lobes.
- Fibrosis: commonly UIP pattern in lower lobes (subpleural reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, honeycombing).
- “CPFE feel”: relatively preserved lung volumes despite extensive fibrosis.
### Pitfall
Paraseptal emphysema cysts can mimic honeycombing. True honeycombing usually comes with other fibrotic signs (traction bronchiectasis, architectural distortion) and **stacked** subpleural cysts with shared walls.
___
## Top differentials
- Emphysema with mild basal scarring or dependent atelectasis: fibrosis not extensive, limited architectural distortion.
- Fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis with emphysema: air-trapping, mosaic attenuation, distribution not classic basal-subpleural UIP.
- Smoking-related ILD (RB-ILD/DIP) with emphysema: more ground-glass than architectural distortion, less definite UIP morphology.
