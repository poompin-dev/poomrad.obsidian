Non-encapsulated fatty overgrowth of the interatrial septum, typically in obese elderly patients, classically sparing the fossa ovalis and giving a “dumbbell/waist” shape. Benign but can look scary + be FDG-avid.

## Imaging features
### CT
- Low attenuation fat in interatrial septum (≈ –80 to –120 HU)  
- Marked thickening (cutoff often >2 cm)  
- Characteristic *dumbbell* shape  (best seen in short axis reconstruction)
- **Spares fossa ovalis** → central thin waist  
- May extend to RA/RV roof; no mass effect capsule or invasion
### MRI
- High T1 / high T2 with India-ink or fat-sat signal drop  
- No enhancement after contrast (other than thin septal vessels)  
- Confirms fat and helps exclude solid tumour
### Echo
- Echogenic thickened septum, sparing fossa ovalis  
- Bulky septum may protrude into RA more than LA
### PET
- Can be **FDG-avid** (brown-fat–like metabolism) → classic pitfall for “cardiac malignancy”.

## Differentials – how to tell apart
- **Atrial lipoma**  
	- Encapsulated, discrete mass, may not spare fossa ovalis  
	- No “waisted dumbbell” shape.

- **Cardiac metastasis / sarcoma / lymphoma**  
	- Soft-tissue attenuation, *not* fat density  
	- Infiltrative, enhancing, often multifocal or with pericardial/adjacent involvement.

- **Thrombus**  
	- Non-enhancing soft tissue, usually in appendage
	- No macroscopic fat, often associated with AF, low flow.

## Associations & clinical angle

- Elderly, obese patients; often with **atrial arrhythmias (esp. AF)**  
- Rarely SVC/RA inflow obstruction, conduction disturbance.

> [!warning] Reporting tip  
> - State: “Features typical of lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum – benign.”  
> - Mention: arrhythmia association; any mass-effect on RA/SVC if present.  
> - Reassure: no imaging features of neoplasm.
