Shearing injury of axons from rapid acceleration–deceleration / rotational head trauma → microscopic axonal damage ± tiny haemorrhages, often with **CT that looks “too normal” for the level of coma**.

> [!summary]
> Think: unconscious patient after high-energy trauma, minimal mass lesion, MRI shows multiple tiny lesions at **grey–white junction, corpus callosum, brainstem**.

---
## Pathophysiology & terminology
- Sudden rotational forces → stretch and shear axons → axonal swelling and disconnection (secondary [[31_Other knowledge/Pathology/Wallerian degeneration\|Wallerian degeneration]]).
- Usually associated with high-speed RTCs, falls from height, shaken-baby.
- **DAI** = original histopathological term.  
- **TAI** often used as the imaging term (same concept for exams).

---
## Typical locations
1. **Cerebral hemispheric white matter**
	- Grey–white junction (especially frontal + temporal lobes)
	- Centrum semiovale, corona radiata
2. **Corpus callosum**
	- Classically splenium, also body
3. **Dorsolateral upper brainstem**
	- Superior cerebellar peduncles, tegmentum, periaqueductal region

Shortcut (with caveats):  
- Grade 1 = hemispheres only  
- Grade 2 = + corpus callosum  
- Grade 3 = + brainstem

## Imaging
### CT
- **CT can be normal in many patients** (especially non-haemorrhagic DAI).
- When positive:
	- Tiny punctate hyperdensities at grey–white junction and corpus callosum (haemorrhagic foci).
	- No (or only mild) mass effect compared with clinical status.
- Frequently coexists with other TBI findings (contusions, SDH, SAH).

Exam line: *“Severe coma with essentially normal CT → suspect DAI → MRI.”*

### MRI (key sequences)
### T2/FLAIR
- Small hyperintense foci in the classic locations above.
- May be subtle early; best seen after **24–48 h**.

### GRE / SWI (most sensitive for haemorrhagic DAI)
- Multiple tiny **blooming** microhaemorrhages
- Number and depth of lesions roughly correlate with severity and prognosis.
### DWI
- Restricted diffusion foci (non-haemorrhagic axonal injury).
- Helpful when GRE/SWI is negative or lesions are very small.

## Clinical / exam nuggets
- Mechanism: high-speed deceleration, rotational injury, fall from height, shaken infant.
- Presentation:
	- Immediate loss of consciousness, often prolonged coma.
	- Neurological status **out of proportion to CT findings**.
- Prognosis worsens with:
	- Increasing grade (especially brainstem involvement).
	- Number and volume of microhaemorrhages.
- DAI is a major cause of long-term cognitive and behavioural deficits after TBI.
