| Feature           | **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/CNS infection/HIV-related/HIV encephalopathy\|HIVE]] (HIV encephalopathy)**                                                                            | **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/CNS infection/HIV-related/Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\|PML]] (JC virus)**                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Core idea         | Diffuse HIV-related white matter injury (encephalopathy), often with **global brain atrophy**                                    | Opportunistic **demyelination** from JC virus reactivation in severe immunosuppression                                                                  |
| Distribution      | **Symmetric** deep/periventricular WM (centrum semiovale, periventricular), ± basal ganglia involvement; tends to be **diffuse** | **Multifocal, asymmetric** subcortical WM; classically **parieto-occipital**; **U-fibre involvement is common**; can hit cerebellar peduncles/brainstem |
| Mass effect       | **None / minimal**                                                                                                               | **None / minimal** (big lesions can look “busy” but usually little mass effect)                                                                         |
| Enhancement       | Usually **none**                                                                                                                 | Classically **none**; **can enhance in IRIS** (new/worsening enhancement after ART)                                                                     |
| DWI               | Often **no marked restriction** (may be subtle/variable)                                                                         | **Peripheral “leading edge” restriction** can be a big clue (active demyelination rim)                                                                  |
| Cortex / U-fibres | Tends to **spare U-fibres** (not a perfect rule)                                                                                 | **Involves U-fibres** early/commonly (subcortical scalloped margin)                                                                                     |
| Atrophy           | **Prominent diffuse atrophy** (out of proportion for age) is a classic exam hint                                                 | Atrophy not the primary feature (can develop later)                                                                                                     |
| Clinical tempo    | Subacute cognitive decline, gait issues, behavioural change; improves/stabilises with ART                                        | Subacute focal neuro deficits, visual symptoms, language/motor; often progressive without immune reconstitution                                         |
| “Gotcha”          | Can look like nonspecific leukoencephalopathy → don’t overcall PML if it’s **very symmetric + atrophic**                         | Don’t dismiss because there’s no enhancement/mass effect; think PML when **asymmetric U-fibre lesions** in immunosuppressed                             |
## Imaging “tell-apart” heuristics
- **Symmetric diffuse WM change + striking atrophy → think HIVE first.**
- **Asymmetric multifocal subcortical lesions involving U-fibres ± peripheral DWI rim restriction → think PML.**
- **New enhancement/oedema after starting ART → consider PML-IRIS** (or another inflammatory/infectious process).
