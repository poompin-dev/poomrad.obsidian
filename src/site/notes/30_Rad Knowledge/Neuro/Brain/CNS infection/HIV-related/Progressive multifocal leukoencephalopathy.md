> [!summary]
> Opportunistic **JC virus–related demyelination** in immunosuppressed patients: **multifocal, asymmetric subcortical WM lesions with U-fibre involvement** and typically **little/no enhancement or mass effect**.
## Clinical
Subacute progressive focal neuro deficits (visual, language, motor, cognitive) in severe immunosuppression (HIV/AIDS, transplant, biologics).
___
## Imaging features
### MRI
- **Multifocal, asymmetric** T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions in **subcortical white matter**.
- **U-fibre involvement** common (scalloped juxtacortical margin).
- Predilection: **parieto-occipital** > frontal; can involve **cerebellar peduncles/brainstem**.
- **No / minimal mass effect**.
- **No / minimal enhancement** classically.
- DWI: **peripheral “leading edge” restriction** (active demyelination rim) with higher ADC centrally (variable but helpful).
### CT
- Hypodense subcortical WM lesions; often underestimates extent vs MRI.
___
## Key differentials
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/CNS infection/HIV-related/HIV encephalopathy\|HIV encephalopathy]] (HIVE)**: **symmetric** deep/periventricular WM change + **prominent diffuse atrophy**; usually lacks U-fibre pattern.
- **Toxoplasmosis / lymphoma**: typically **enhancing** (often ring/solid), more oedema/mass effect; consider basal ganglia for toxo.
- **PRES**: vasogenic oedema, often symmetric posterior; clinical BP/trigger context.

> [!warning]
> **PML-IRIS**: after starting/optimising ART (or immune reconstitution) → lesions may **enhance** and swell; don’t discard PML just because enhancement appears.
