> [!summary]
> - HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder with **diffuse HIV-related white matter injury**
> - Imaging clue = **symmetric WM change + disproportionate global atrophy**.

## Clinical
- Subacute cognitive/behavioural slowing ± gait disturbance in advanced HIV
- Typically improves/stabilises with effective ART (but imaging may lag).
___
## Imaging features
### MRI
- **Symmetric** T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in **deep/periventricular white matter** (centrum semiovale, periventricular regions).
- **Relative sparing of subcortical U-fibres** (not absolute).
- **Diffuse cerebral atrophy** often disproportionate for age:
	- Sulcal widening + ventriculomegaly (non-obstructive).
	- Corpus callosum thinning (supportive, nonspecific).
- **No / minimal mass effect**.
- **No / minimal enhancement**.
- DWI: usually **no marked restriction**.
### CT
- Low attenuation in periventricular/deep WM + **generalised atrophy**; nonspecific but supportive in context.
___
## Key differentials
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/CNS infection/HIV-related/Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\|PML]]**: tends to be **asymmetric**, multifocal, **U-fibre involvement**, ± **peripheral DWI “leading edge” restriction**; enhancement mainly with **IRIS**.
- Small vessel disease/toxic–metabolic leukoencephalopathy: consider age/risk factors; usually less “HIV-style” atrophy pattern in young.

> [!warning]
> Don’t overcall PML if the pattern is **very symmetric** with **prominent atrophy** and little else.
