## Exam points
[Striated/tigroid appearance](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dysplastic-cerebellar-gangliocytoma-1?lang=us) of the cerebellar hemisphere leaves is essentially pathognomonic. 
**Buzz-phrase**
"**Unilaterally enlarged cerebellar hemisphere with thickened folia** showing non-enhancing **T2 hyperintense, ‘tiger-striped’ striations** (WHO grade I dysplastic gangliocytoma)."

Because it is strongly associated with [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/Cowden syndrome\|Cowden syndrome]], further management includes imaging or clinical assessment for associated tumours, particularly:
- Breast 
- Endometrial
- Thyroid

## Trivia
- Also known as **Lhermitte–Duclos disease**.
- Part of [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/PTEN-related diseases\|PTEN-related diseases]]: adult Lhermitte–Duclos disease is a **major diagnostic criterion** for PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome ([[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/Cowden syndrome\|Cowden syndrome]]) in current guidelines.
	- Adult LDD → think **PTEN testing + lifelong screening** for breast, thyroid, endometrial (± renal/colorectal) tumours.
- Many associated malformations are identified, consistent with PTEN/PI3K-AKT-mTOR overgrowth spectrum.
- When Lhermitte-Duclos disease is a manifestation of Cowden syndrome, it is termed **COLD syndrome** (Cowden-Lhermitte-Duclos syndrome)
- In contrast to adult-onset disease, paediatric cases typically **do not show** _PTEN_ mutations.
