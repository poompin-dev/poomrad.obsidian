## Type
### Physiologic
- Puberty
- Young menstruating female
- Pregnancy
- Lactation
- Exogenous estrogen treatment
### Pathologic
End-organ failure
- Primary hypothyroidism (M/C cause of pathologic hyperplasia)
- Primary gonadal failure
___
## Imaging features
- **Diffuse, symmetric pituitary enlargement** with **convex superior margin**.
- **Homogeneous enhancement**, **no focal nodule**, **no cavernous sinus invasion**.
- **Stalk midline and normal thickness** (key vs hypophysitis/adenoma).
### CT
No bone erosion.
### MRI
- Can contact optic chiasm.
- Isointense with cortex on both T1-and T2WI.
- shape preserved, just ‘plump’
___
## Differential diagnosis
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Pituitary adenoma\|Macroadenoma]]
	- Often **focal/off-midline mass**, heterogeneous, can invade cavernous sinus.
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Hypophysitis\|Lymphocytic hypophysitis]] common in pregnant and postpartum
	- Other causes of hypophysitis e.g. IgG4-related, drug-related hypophysitis
	- **Thick, non-tapering stalk**, often **loss of posterior bright spot**, **DI more common**.
- [[Intracranial hypotension\|Intracranial hypotension]]
	- Engorged pituitary
	- Brain sagging
	- Pachymeningeal enhancement
	- Small ventricles
