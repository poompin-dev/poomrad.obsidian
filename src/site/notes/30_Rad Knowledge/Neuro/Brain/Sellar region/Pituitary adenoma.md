## Terminology
- Microadenoma: < 10 mm
- Macroadenoma: ≥ 10 mm
## Epidemiology
- Among the most common of all CNS neoplasms (10-15% of primary intracranial neoplasms).
- Microadenoma is much more common than macroadenoma.
- Peak age of presentation is 4th-7th decades. 
	- In a **child with a diffusely enlarged, homogeneously enhancing gland**, think **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Pituitary hyperplasia\|pituitary hyperplasia]]** (e.g. primary hypothyroidism, puberty, end-organ failure) before adenoma.
## Clinical
### General
- **Diabetes insipidus at presentation is uncommon** with adenoma and should make you think of other pathology (craniopharyngioma, metastasis, LCH, hypophysitis, etc.)
- Malignant degeneration into pituitary carcinoma is exceptionally rare.
	- Invasive-looking macroadenoma ≠ malignant → need craniospinal spread or distant metastasis to confirm malignancy.
### Microadenoma
Most **microadenomas are functioning**; among these:
- **Prolactinomas are the commonest**
- Then **GH** (acromegaly/gigantism)
- Then **ACTH** (Cushing disease)
- TSH is rare.
### Macroadenoma
- Macroadenomas generally present with mass effect (headache, bitemporal hemianopia).
- Slowly growing over a period of years.
- Cavernous sinus invasion is **common in larger macroadenomas** and is graded with **Knosp**.
    - **Knosp 3–4 = definite invasion** → key surgical planning point.

## Imaging features
### Macroadenoma
Large sellar ± suprasellar mass; normal gland often only a thin peripheral rim or not well-visualized.
#### CT
- NECT: variable attenuation (usually isodense with grey matter)
- Bone window: enlarged, remodeled sella turcica
	- Giant adenomas can erode and extensively invade the skull base
- Cysts (15-20%)
- Hemorrhage (10%)
- Calcification is rare (2%)
- CECT: Moderate but heterogeneous enhancement
#### MR
- Macroadenomas usually isointense with cortex on T1-and T2WIs
	- Can demonstrate heterogenous signal intensity on T2WI
- Small cysts and hemorrhagic foci are common
	- "Blooming" on T2* sequences
- Fluid-fluid levels can be present (ddx [[pituitary apoplexy\|pituitary apoplexy]])
- Strongly but heterogeneously enhance
- [[70_Glossary/Neuro/Posterior pituitary bright spot\|Posterior pituitary bright spot]] usually preserved
- Subtle dural thickening (a dural tail) can be seen (5-10%)
  Meningioma mimic, but adenoma tends to have more irregular invasion of cavernous sinus, no calcified/hyperostotic bone.
- Buzzwords
	- **“Snowman / figure-of-eight”** suprasellar extension (waist at diaphragma sellae).
    - **Suprasellar mass elevating the optic chiasm from below**.
#### DDx of macroadenoma
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Pituitary hyperplasia\|Pituitary hyperplasia]]
- [[Meningioma\|Meningioma]] of the diaphragmatic sellae
- Metastasis (uncommon)
	- Often **loss of posterior pituitary bright spot** + **early DI**.
	- Common primary includes:
		- breast
		- lung
		- systemic [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Lymphoma\|lymphoma]]
			- infiltrative low T2 signal
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Craniopharyngioma\|Craniopharyngioma]]
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Hypophysitis\|Hypophysitis]]:
	- Symmetrical gland enlargement, homogeneous enhancement, thick, non-tapering stalk
	- Often in post-partum female or on immune checkpoint inhibitors.
- Aneurysm >> look for flow void and eccentricity in origin
### Microadenoma
#### MR
- **Pre-contrast**: often **mildly hypointense or inapparent**.
- **Standard delayed post-contrast**: may be **iso-enhancing → occult**.
- **Dynamic contrast**:
    - Normal pituitary enhances **early and avidly**.
    - Microadenoma enhances **more slowly**, so on **early dynamic phase** it appears as a **focal hypoenhancing nodule**.
- Optional nuance: some microadenomas can be **T1 hyperintense** if haemorrhagic/proteinaceous.
#### DDx of microadenoma
- Intrapituitary cysts (esp. cystic microadenoma)
	- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Rathke’s cleft cyst\|Rathke’s cleft cyst]]:
	  Usually **non-enhancing**, may have **intracystic nodule**, often **midline**.
	- Pars intermedia cyst

> [!important] Exam pearls
> - **DI at presentation → think NOT adenoma** (met, [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Craniopharyngioma\|craniopharyngioma]], LCH, hypophysitis).
> - **Snowman macroadenoma** with widened sella and suprasellar cap.
> - **Hook effect**:
> 	- Huge macroadenoma with only mild prolactin elevation → **repeat prolactin with dilution**.
> - **Knosp 3–4 = definite cavernous sinus invasion**.
> - **Physiologic / reactive [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Pituitary hyperplasia\|hyperplasia]]**:
> 	- Diffuse, homogeneous enlargement; entire gland big but symmetric.
> 	- Focal asymmetric lesion with delayed enhancement → adenoma more likely.
