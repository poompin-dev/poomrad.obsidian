Rare, usually benign **TTF-1–positive** posterior pituitary tumour that commonly presents as a **solid enhancing stalk/suprasellar mass**.

> [!warning]
> Not the same beast as “Abrikossoff” [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Granular cell tumour\|Granular cell tumour]] (Schwann-cell, tongue/breast/skin). This one is a **posterior pituitary (pituicyte-derived) tumour** and sits in the **stalk/posterior lobe** family with **pituicytoma** and **spindle cell oncocytoma**.
## Typical clinical clues
- Symptoms from mass effect: **visual disturbance/headache**; endocrine: **hypopituitarism** ± **mild hyperprolactinaemia (stalk effect)**.
## Imaging features
- **Location:** posterior lobe and/or **infundibulum**, often **sellar–suprasellar** with stalk involvement; may lose the normal [[70_Glossary/Neuro/Posterior pituitary bright spot\|posterior pituitary bright spot]].
- **MRI signal:** classically **T1 isointense** and **T2 iso-to-hypointense**
- **Enhancement:** usually **avid enhancement** (often fairly solid).
- **CT:** can be relatively **hyperdense**; calcification is uncommon.
## Differentials
- **Pituicytoma / spindle cell oncocytoma:** same family + similar imaging → often indistinguishable radiologically; pathology (TTF-1+, other markers) decides. 
- **Meningioma (tuberculum/diaphragma):** dural tail, broad dural base, hyperostosis.
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Hypophysitis\|Hypophysitis]] (incl. IgG4/drug-related):** stalk thickening + inflammatory context; DI more common.
- **Germinoma / LCH / metastasis:** stalk + DI + systemic clues; consider age and extracranial disease.
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Craniopharyngioma\|Craniopharyngioma]]:** cystic + calcified pattern, different texture.
