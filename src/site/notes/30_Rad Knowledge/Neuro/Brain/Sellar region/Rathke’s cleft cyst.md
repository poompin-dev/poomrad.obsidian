> [!summary]  
> - Benign midline sellar cyst.
> - Midline, pars intermedia–centred cyst, **non‑enhancing “waxy” intracystic nodule** (T1 bright, T2 dark), and **rare calcification**. 
> - Most are incidental; symptomatic when large.

## Clinical
- Most asymptomatic and stable; mean age at presentation ≈ **45 y**.
	- Adamantinomatous [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Craniopharyngioma\|craniopharyngioma]]: more **paediatric**.
- If symptomatic: headache, visual field defect, hypopituitarism. 
	- Diabetes insipidus is **uncommon** but possible.
## Pathology
- Epithelium‑lined cyst from Rathke’s pouch (oral ectoderm in origin); mucinous/proteinaceous content.
- **Intracystic nodule** = inspissated mucin/“waxy” material.
- **Squamous metaplasia** of the cyst wall is associated with higher risk of post‑op re‑accumulation.
___
## Imaging
Well‑delineated round/ovoid lesion **within or just above the sella**, centred in the **pars intermedia** (midline). Pituitary stalk may be displaced rather than invaded.
### CT
- ~**75%** hypodense, **~20%** mixed density, **~5–10%** hyperdense.
- **Calcification is rare** (contrast with [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Craniopharyngioma\|craniopharyngioma]] where calcification is common).
### MRI
- **T1‑weighted imaging (T1WI):** ~**50%** hyperintense, ~**50%** hypointense (depends on protein/mucin).
- **T2‑weighted imaging (T2WI):** **Usually hyperintense**; **~25–30%** hypointense.
- **FLAIR (fluid‑attenuated inversion recovery):** almost always hyperintense.
- **Intracystic nodule (“waxy nodule”):** classically **T1 hyperintense**, **T2 hypointense**, **non‑enhancing**. Frequency variable.
- Enhancement: thin peripheral rim only; **no solid enhancing component**.
- **“Claw sign”:** enhancing compressed normal pituitary tissue partially surrounds the non‑enhancing cyst.
- **Diffusion:** variable; not a reliable discriminator.

## Differentials
- **Adamantinomatous [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Craniopharyngioma\|craniopharyngioma]]:** 
	- “**Machinery/motor oil**” cyst fluid
	- **Calcifications common**
	- **Solid/mural enhancement**
	- More frequent suprasellar/hypothalamic involvement.
- **Non‑functioning cystic [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Pituitary adenoma\|microadenoma]]:** overlap exists but
	- Often **off‑midline/asymmetric**
	- **Enhancing mural/solid tissue**
	- Haemorrhagic/proteinaceous cyst with possible **fluid–fluid levels**.
- **Arachnoid cyst:** CSF signal on all sequences; **no nodule**, **no enhancement**.
- **Epidermoid:** insinuating margins and **diffusion restriction**.
## Management
- **Asymptomatic/small:** observation.
- **Symptomatic/large:** 
	- Transsphenoidal **fenestration/marsupialisation** is typical
	- Many surgeons avoid aggressive capsule stripping to preserve pituitary function.
## Recurrence / Follow‑up
- **Not intrinsically “recurrent,”** but **re‑accumulation** can occur if the epithelial wall remains after fenestration.
- Risk is higher with
	- Residual capsule
	- **Squamous metaplasia**
	- Suprasellar extension
- Routine **clinical + MRI follow‑up** after surgery; earlier imaging if symptoms recur.

> [!warning] Common traps  
> **T1‑bright content ≠ haemorrhage by default.** Corroborate with a **non‑enhancing intracystic nodule** and lack of susceptibility. **Calcification, restrict diffusion, or a true enhancing mural nodule** should push you away from RCC (consider [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Craniopharyngioma\|craniopharyngioma]] or [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Pituitary adenoma\|pituitary adenoma]]).
