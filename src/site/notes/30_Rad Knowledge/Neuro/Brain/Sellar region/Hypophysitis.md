Inflammatory disorder of the **pituitary gland**, often mimicking [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Pituitary adenoma\|adenoma]].

## Causes / types
- **Lymphocytic**: classic, pregnancy/post-partum, autoimmune.
- **IgG4-related**.
- **Granulomatous**: sarcoidosis, TB.
- **Drug-related**: immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. ipilimumab, nivolumab).
- Xanthomatous / mixed (rarer).

## Clinical
- Headache, fatigue, visual disturbance.
- **Hypopituitarism** common; **diabetes insipidus** more frequent than in adenoma.
- May present with acute/subacute pituitary failure in ICI patients.

## Imaging features
- **Symmetrical gland enlargement**, “plump” pituitary.
- **Homogeneous enhancement**.
- **Thick, non-tapering stalk**.
- [[70_Glossary/Neuro/Posterior pituitary bright spot\|Posterior pituitary bright spot]] often **lost**.
- Can show dural/infundibular enhancement; in ICI-hypophysitis, sometimes a peripheral “ring” of enhancement.

## Differential diagnosis
Main ddx = macroadenoma
- Adenoma usually **asymmetric**, off-midline, more cavernous sinus invasion, snowman shape.
- Hypophysitis favours **symmetry + thick stalk + DI**.

## Management:
High-dose **steroids** often lead to shrinkage; avoid unnecessary trans-sphenoidal surgery when imaging strongly suggests hypophysitis.
