> [!summary]  
>  Two types: **adamantinomatous** (paediatric‑predominant; calcified; sticky; “**machinery/motor oil**” cysts) and **papillary** (adult‑only; smoother; often third‑ventricular; calcification uncommon). Typically **suprasellar with sellar extension**, **high recurrence risk**, especially after subtotal resection so **long‑term imaging follow‑up** is standard.

Locally aggressive with high morbidity but benign **oral ectodermal tumour** from Rathke’s pouch remnants.

Patients can present with **visual disturbance**, **headache**, behavioural change and **endocrine dysfunction** (growth failure, delayed puberty, hypopituitarism, **diabetes insipidus**, hypothalamic obesity).
### Adamantinomatous type
Majority overall; most common non‑glial suprasellar tumour in children.
- Multiloculated cysts with cholesterol crystals and wet keratin → **“machinery oil”** fluid.
- Irregular, adherent margins; often stick to the hypothalamus/optic chiasm.
- Classic **bimodal** age distribution (large peak 5–15 y; smaller peak middle‑aged adults).
### Papillary type
Adult‑only (30–60 y).
- More discrete, encapsulated solid/cystic mass; **rare calcification**.
- Frequently arises in/extends to the **third ventricle**.
- Molecular: often **BRAF V600E‑mutant** (therapeutic implications in recurrence).
## Location & size
- **Primarily suprasellar**; intrasellar‑only is uncommon.
- May be largely/entirely **third ventricular** (especially papillary).
- Lesions can be large; mass effect on chiasm and hydrocephalus possible.

## Imaging features
May see a **separate, compressed pituitary gland** below a predominantly suprasellar mass.
### CT
**Adamantinomatous “rule of 90”** teaching pearl:
- ~90% **mixed cystic/solid** (papillary more often solid).
- ~90% **calcified** (coarse/eggshell); **papillary rarely calcified**.
- ~90% **enhance** (solid parts/capsule).
### MRI
- **Cyst content**: variable; **T1 hyperintense** pockets typical from cholesterol/protein (the “machinery oil” sign). T2 variable by protein/haemorrhage.
- **Solid components/capsule**: **enhance**; look for **lobulated mural/solid tissue**.
- **Calcification**: blooming/signal voids on GRE/SWI.
- **Optic tract hyperintensity on T2/FLAIR** is common and usually reflects **oedema**, not tumour invasion.
- **Pituitary stalk**: may be displaced or thickened; hypothalamic involvement is prognostically relevant.
___
## Management
- Surgical debulking/resection when symptomatic or threatening vision; maximal safe resection; avoid hypothalamic devastation if possible
- **Adjuvant radiotherapy** often used for residual/recurrent disease.
- **Targeted therapy** can be considered in **papillary (BRAF‑mutant)** recurrence under multidisciplinary care.
## Recurrence / Follow‑up
- **Tends to recur** after surgery; risk relates to residual tumour and hypothalamic involvement.
- Requires **long‑term clinical + MRI follow‑up** (years), adjusted to local protocol and extent of resection.

## Differentials
Child suprasellar mass
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Rathke’s cleft cyst\|Rathke’s cleft cyst]]:** midline **rim‑only** enhancement, **non‑enhancing “waxy” intracystic nodule**, **calcification rare**; often smaller and less aggressive interface.
- **Cystic/non‑functioning [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/Sellar region/Pituitary adenoma\|adenoma]]:** often **off‑midline/asymmetric** with **enhancing mural/solid tissue**; can show **fluid–fluid levels**.
- **Arachnoid cyst:** CSF signal on all sequences; **no enhancement, no nodule**.
- **Epidermoid:** insinuating margins; **diffusion restriction**.
- **Optic pathway glioma**
- **Germinoma**

> [!warning] Common traps  
> **T1‑bright cyst alone is not specific.** Correlate with **calcification** and **solid enhancement**. If there’s **no solid component** and a classic **waxy intracystic nodule**, reconsider RCC. **Restricted diffusion** argues for epidermoid, not CP.
