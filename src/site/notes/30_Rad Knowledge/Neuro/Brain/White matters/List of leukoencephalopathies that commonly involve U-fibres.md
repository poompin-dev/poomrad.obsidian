**U-fibres (subcortical arcuate fibres)** sit right under the cortex. The disease involvement represents **juxtacortical/subcortical process** rather than “pure periventricular deep WM” disease.
## Acquired
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/CNS infection/HIV-related/Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\|PML]] (JC virus)** – classic **asymmetric** subcortical lesions with U-fibre involvement.
- **Multiple sclerosis** – **juxtacortical plaques** (touching cortex) are a core pattern.
- **ADEM** (and **MOGAD**-spectrum demyelination) – large “fluffy” cortical–subcortical lesions can hit U-fibres.
- **PRES** – vasogenic oedema often **posterior**, frequently involves subcortical WM including U-fibres.
## Genetic
- Canavan disease.
