These entities at least leave thin “juxtacortical rim” relatively normal in its earlier course.

- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Brain/CNS infection/HIV-related/HIV encephalopathy\|HIV encephalopathy]] (HIVE)**: diffuse **deep/periventricular** WM change + atrophy; U-fibres relatively spared
- **Chronic small-vessel ischaemic change** (microangiopathy / Binswanger pattern): periventricular/deep WM; **U-fibres usually spared**
- **Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy**: demyelination of deep WM/centrum semiovale with relative U-fibre sparing
- **Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD)**: symmetric periventricular/deep WM, often “tigroid” pattern; **U-fibres spared until late**
- **Krabbe disease**: deep WM + corticospinal tracts; **U-fibres often spared early**
- **X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD)**: posterior peritrigonal/parieto-occipital WM; **U-fibres typically spared early**, may be involved as it advances
- **Vanishing white matter disease**: diffuse rarefaction/cystic degeneration of deep WM with relative **subcortical rim preservation**
