---

Metastatic deposit within the spinal cord parenchyma causing acute/subacute myelopathy; uncommon but high-stakes because treatment is time-sensitive.
## Clinical
- Rapidly progressive limb weakness, sensory level, sphincter symptoms
- Often known systemic malignancy, but can be first presentation
- Primary sites commonly lung, breast, melanoma, renal; also lymphoma/leukaemia
___
## Imaging features
### MRI (primary tool)
- Short segment intramedullary enhancing nodule or mass, often eccentric
- Marked surrounding T2 hyperintense oedema that can be long-segment and disproportionate to lesion size
- Variable cord expansion
- Specific enhancement patterns:
	- [[Rim sign\|Rim sign]]: thin peripheral rim of more intense enhancement
	- [[Flame sign\|Flame sign]]: ill-defined tapering enhancement at superior/inferior margin
- Look for accompanying leptomeningeal disease or other spine/brain metastases
___
## Top differentials
- Ependymoma: 
	- Central, smoother expansion
	- May have cyst/syrinx
	- Haemorrhage can occur
- Astrocytoma: longer segment infiltrative expansion, less discrete nodule
- Demyelination (MS/NMOSD/MOGAD): 
	- Clinical context
	- Lesions often longer or multifocal
	- Enhancement less nodular
- Intramedullary abscess: diffusion restriction, infection context
