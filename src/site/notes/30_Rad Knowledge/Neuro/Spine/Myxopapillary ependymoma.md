> [!summary] Core idea
> - Slow-growing ependymal tumour from the filum terminale, usually **intradural extramedullary** in the lumbosacral canal, with **myxoid stroma** and **non-trivial risk of CSF seeding**.

## Demographics & location
- Age: adolescents–young adults (but can be paediatric).
- Slight male predominance.
- Classic: **conus / filum terminale / cauda equina (L2–S2)**.
- Rare ectopic sites: thoracic spine, intracranial (sacral/coccygeal remnants).

## Imaging - MRI

> [!info] Typical spinal MRI pattern
> - Central intradural extramedullary mass, “**sausage-shaped**” along filum.
> - May span **multiple vertebral levels**.
> - Often causes **expansion** of canal + posterior vertebral body scalloping.

- **Location**: Intradural extramedullary, central, attached to filum (vs eccentric nerve root mass).
- **Signal**
	- T1: iso–hypointense; hyperintense to cord
		- patchy T1-bright mucin/haemorrhage.
	- T2: hyperintense, heterogeneous; cysts/septa possible.
		- Hypointensity at tumor margin = hemosiderin
	- GRE/SWI: peripheral low-signal **“cap sign”** (haemosiderin).
- **Post-contrast**
	- Strong, often homogeneous enhancement ± small cystic areas.
- **Secondary features**
	- Canal widening, remodelling/scalloping.
	- **Drop metastases** along neuraxis in more aggressive/relapsed cases.
## Key differentials
Think “central filum vs eccentric nerve root”
- **Conventional conus ependymoma**: intramedullary, cord expansion, less clearly extramedullary.
- **Schwannoma / neurofibroma**: usually **eccentric**, dumb-bell through foramen, ± target sign, less typical cap sign.
- **Filum paraganglioma (cauda equina neuroendocrine tumor*)**: similar level but **very vascular** – flow voids + “salt-and-pepper” appearance.
- **Meningioma (lumbar rare)**: dural-based, dural tail, older female, thoracic > lumbar.
- **Intradural metastases**
