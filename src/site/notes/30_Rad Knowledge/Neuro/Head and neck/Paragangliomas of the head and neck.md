> [!summary] Core idea
Slow growing, but locally destructive neuroendocrine tumours arising from **parasympathetic paraganglia** (neural crest origin) in the classic head and neck locations, usually **non–catecholamine-secreting but highly vascular**, seen as intense enhancement and “salt-and-pepper” MRI.

---
## Genetics & syndromes 
- H&N PG particularly often hereditary (often quoted ≥50%).
- Key genes:
	- **SDHX (SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2)** – “paraganglioma syndromes”.
		- **SDHD, SDHAF2** → often **multiple head and neck paragangliomas**.
		- **SDHB** → higher risk of **metastatic** disease (esp. extra-adrenal trunk/abdomen).
	- ± [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/Von Hippel-Lindau (overview)\|VHL]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/Neurofibromatosis type 1\|NF1]], RET (MEN2) mainly in [[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Adrenal gland/Phaeochromocytoma - Paraganglioma\|adrenal phaeochromocytoma]] context.

> [!tip] Imaging implication  
> Multiple lesions? Young patient? → **think SDH mutation** and **screen whole paraganglionic axis** (skull base to pelvis).
### Trivia
| Head & neck PG                                              | Thoracoabdominal PG                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Parasympathetic origin                                      | Sympathetic origin                     |
| Usually non-functional (no systemic catecholamine symptoms) | Often functional/pheochromocytoma-like |
- PG is usually slow-growing but can metastasise; malignancy defined by nodal/distant spread (lung, bone), **not histology**.
	- Risk is higher in **SDHB**-mutation carriers.

## Clinical features
- Age: usually middle-aged adults; can present younger if hereditary.
- Sex: slight **female** predominance overall.
- Generally slow-growing but locally aggressive.
### Symptoms
Patients usually present with mass or symptoms according to local tumour destruction.
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Head and neck/Skull base/Carotid body tumour\|Carotid body tumour]]** (at carotid bifurcation)
	- Painless **lateral neck mass** at angle of mandible.
	- Sometimes pulsatile, ± bruit.
	- Large lesions → lower cranial nerve palsies (IX–XII) → dysphagia, hoarseness.
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Head and neck/Skull base/Glomus jugulare tumour\|Glomus jugulare]] / jugulotympanic** (in jugular foramen/extending to middle ear)
	- Pulsatile tinnitus, conductive hearing loss, aural fullness.
	- Lower cranial nerve palsies (IX, X, XI ± XII).
	- Retrotympanic red mass on otoscopy (jugulotympanic).
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Head and neck/Ear and temporal bone/Glomus tympanicum\|Glomus tympanicum]]** (at middle ear cavity)
	- Smaller retrotympanic red mass.
	- Conductive hearing loss, pulsatile tinnitus.
	- **Confined to middle ear**, jugular foramen intact.
- **Glomus vagale** (along vagus nerve in high carotid space)
	- **High neck mass** in carotid space.
	- Vagal palsy → hoarseness, cough, dysphagia.
	- ± Other lower CN involvement, Horner if sympathetic chain involved.

Laryngeal, nasopharyngeal, and other skull-base paragangliomas can happen but are way less common.

Systemic catecholamine symptoms are rare in head & neck paragangliomas.

## Imaging

> [!info] Signature imaging appearance  
> **Hypervascular** soft-tissue mass with:  
> - Intense, often **early enhancement**.  
> - **“Salt-and-pepper” on MRI** (flow voids + slow-flow/haemorrhage).  
> - Location-specific vessel displacement patterns.

### CT
- Soft tissue:
	- Strong enhancement.
	- Lobulated margins common.
- Bone:
	- **Jugular foramen lesions** → bone destruction/widening (glomus jugulare).
	- Carotid-space lesions → usually **no bone erosion** unless very large.
### MRI
- **T1**: iso–hypointense to muscle.
- **T2**: hyperintense; often heterogenous.
- **Salt-and-pepper**:
	- **Pepper** = flow voids from high-flow vessels.
	- **Salt** = high-signal foci (slow flow, haemorrhage).
	- However, very small PGs may just look uniformly bright.
- Avid post-contrast enhancement.
### Angiography (DSA)
- Intense tumour blush with early draining veins.
- Useful for:
	- Confirming hypervascular nature.
	- Mapping arterial feeders.
	- **Pre-operative embolisation planning**.
		- Typical feeders: **ascending pharyngeal, occipital, posterior auricular branches of ECA** (esp. for CB/jugulotympanic).
### Nuclear medicine
- **Somatostatin receptor imaging**:
	- **68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT** – excellent for detection of multifocal disease and metastases.
	- 111In-octreotide (historical).
- **MIBG**: more for functional/adrenergic lesions (adrenal pheo, sympathetic paraganglioma).
- **FDG PET**: can be helpful in **SDHB**-mutant and more aggressive/metastatic disease.
### Location-specific features

| Lesion                  | Key displacement / features                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Carotid body tumour** | Splays **ICA & ECA** (“lyre sign”)                                                          |
| **Glomus vagale**       | Mass **between ICA & IJV** → ICA anteromedial, IJV posterolateral                           |
| **Glomus jugulare**     | **Enlarged/destructed jugular foramen**, may extend to middle ear, mastoid, posterior fossa |
| **Glomus tympanicum**   | Small enhancing mass on **cochlear promontory**; jugular foramen intact                     |

## Management overview
- **Work-up**
	- Full head & neck imaging (CT + MRI).
	- Look for **multiplicity** (other paragangliomas).
	- Consider **chest/abdo/pelvis** imaging for extra lesions / pheo.
	- **Check catecholamines/metanephrines before surgery or embolisation**, especially if there are any systemic symptoms or extra-adrenal lesions, to avoid hypertensive crisis.

- **Treatment**
	Depends on size, symptoms, age, comorbidities, genetic status.
	- **Surgery**: for accessible or symptomatic lesions.
		- ± Pre-operative embolization (esp. [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Head and neck/Skull base/Glomus jugulare tumour\|glomus jugulare]]).
	- **Radiotherapy / stereotactic radiosurgery**: common for skull-base lesions, older or high-risk surgical patients.
	- **Observation (“wait and scan”)**: for small, minimally symptomatic lesions in elderly or high-risk cases.

> [!warning] Management pitfall  
> **Biopsy is generally avoided** because these are highly vascular → risk of significant bleeding. Diagnosis is usually **imaging + clinical + nuclear medicine** ± genetics.

## Summary
- Head & neck paragangliomas = **parasympathetic, usually non-functional**, but **very vascular**.  
- Classic imaging: **salt-and-pepper MRI**, avid enhancement, location-specific vessel displacement.  
- **Carotid body tumour** → carotid bifurcation, **splaying ICA/ECA** (“lyre sign”).   
- **Glomus jugulare** → centred on **jugular foramen** with bone erosion, ± middle-ear extension.  
- **Glomus tympanicum** → small **middle-ear** mass on cochlear promontory, jugular foramen intact.  
- **Glomus vagale** → high carotid space, mass between ICA & IJV, hoarseness from CN X palsy.  
- Always consider **SDH mutation and multifocal disease** → think **whole-axis imaging + genetics**.
- **Avoid biopsy**
