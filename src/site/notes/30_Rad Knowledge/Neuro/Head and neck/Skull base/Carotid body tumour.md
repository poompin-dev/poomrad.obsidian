- [[30_Rad Knowledge/Neuro/Head and neck/Paragangliomas of the head and neck\|Paragangliomas of the head and neck]] at carotid bifurcation → splays **ICA & ECA** (“lyre sign”).
- **Often bilateral/multiple** (esp. familial). So, bilateral carotid body tumours → think SDHx workup.
- Shamblin class (I–III) based on degree of carotid encasement → correlates with surgical difficulty.
## Differential diagnosis
By location (carotid space)
- **Vagal schwannoma**
	- Often **less vascular**, may cause **smooth fusiform expansion** along nerve with cystic change, no intense early enhancement.
- **Hypervascular nodal metastases** (e.g. thyroid, [[30_Rad Knowledge/GU/Kidney/Renal masses/Renal cell carcinoma\|RCC]])
	- Nodal distribution, clinical context of primary malignancy.
	- Lack classic splaying/displacement pattern.
