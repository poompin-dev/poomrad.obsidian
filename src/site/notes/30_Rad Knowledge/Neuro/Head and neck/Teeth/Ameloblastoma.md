**Ameloblastoma** is a benign but locally aggressive odontogenic tumor that typically arises in the mandible.

## Location
   - **Mandible**: Most common site (80-85%), particularly in the molar-ramus region.
   - **Maxilla**: Less common but more aggressive due to proximity to critical structures (e.g., sinus, orbit).

## Imaging
### Radiographic
   - **Multiloculated radiolucency**: Classic "soap-bubble" or "honeycomb" appearance, especially in the mandible.
   - **Unilocular lesions**: May occur in smaller or early-stage lesions, often mimicking other cystic conditions like dentigerous cysts.
   - **Cortical thinning and expansion**: Ameloblastomas cause significant bone expansion with thinning of the cortex but often without perforation.
   - **Root resorption**: Adjacent teeth often show root resorption, a key feature that differentiates it from other lesions.

### CT
   - **Well-defined, expansile lesion**: CT is superior for evaluating cortical bone involvement.
   - **Mixed density**: Primarily lytic with thin septations in multilocular cases.
   - **Cortical breach**: Look for any erosion of the cortex, especially in larger lesions.
   - **Soft tissue involvement**: Advanced cases may show soft tissue extension.

### MRI
   - **T1-weighted**: Typically hypointense.
   - **T2-weighted**: Hyperintense (fluid-filled cystic areas); septations may appear hypointense.
   - **Post-contrast enhancement**: Heterogeneous enhancement due to the solid-cystic nature, with enhanced septa and mural nodules.

## Differential Diagnosis
   - **Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC)**: Similar radiolucent appearance but less expansion and typically without root resorption.
   - **Dentigerous cyst**: Often associated with an unerupted tooth (usually 3rd molar); usually unilocular.
   - **Odontogenic myxoma**: May appear multilocular but with less aggressive features.

## Treatment and Prognosis
   - **Surgical resection**: The treatment of choice, often requiring wide margins due to high recurrence rates.
   - **Recurrence**: Ameloblastomas have a high recurrence rate if not completely excised. Imaging plays a role in detecting post-treatment recurrence.

## Follow-up Imaging
   - **Postoperative**: Look for residual or recurrent disease on follow-up CT or MRI.
   - **Bone graft monitoring**: If reconstructive surgery is performed, follow-up imaging can assess graft viability.
