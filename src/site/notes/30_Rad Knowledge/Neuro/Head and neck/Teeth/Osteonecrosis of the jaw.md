**Core idea:** Exposed, non-healing jaw bone with chronic infection and necrosis, classically in patients on **[[31_Other knowledge/Pharmacology/Bisphosphonate\|bisphosphonate]]/denosumab** or after **radiotherapy**.

---
## Typical setting
- Older patient, **malignancy or [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteoporosis/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]]**.
- History of:
    - IV **bisphosphonate** or **denosumab** (MRONJ), or
    - **Head & neck RT** (osteoradionecrosis).
- Trigger: recent **dental extraction** or chronic dental disease.
- Clue in request: “non-healing socket”, “exposed bone”, “persistent pain/swelling”.

## Imaging features

### Radiograph / OPG
- Often **subtle / late**:
    - **Mixed lytic–sclerotic** change in alveolar bone.
    - **Poorly defined** marrow lucency.
    - Irregular lamina dura, loss of normal trabecular pattern.
    - ± **Sequestra** (dense, dead bone fragment).
    - ± [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Pathological fracture\|Pathological fracture]].
### CT
- Best for **extent** and **sequestra**.
- Findings:
    - **Cortical destruction**, patchy lysis, “moth-eaten” areas.
    - **Sclerosis** and cortical thickening of adjacent bone.
    - **Sequestrum**: dense, devascularised fragment with surrounding lucent rim.
    - **Involucrum**: thickened, sclerotic reactive bone.
    - **Fistulae / sinus tracts**, adjacent collections.
    - Mandible > maxilla (molar region, mylohyoid line).
### MRI
- Marrow:
    - BME signal: **Low T1**, **high STIR/T2** in active inflammatory phase.
    - Sclerotic signal: **low signal on all sequences** in chronic phase
- Soft tissue:
    - Mucosal thickening, **soft tissue phlegmon/abscess**, muscle oedema.
    - Helps exclude **tumour recurrence** in post-RT patients.
### Nuclear medicine
- Bone scan: focal **increased uptake** in active disease, may be **photopenic** in fully necrotic sequestra.
- SPECT-CT: useful to confirm sequestra, guide surgery.

## Key imaging differentials
- **Osteoradionecrosis** – similar imaging; history of RT field is decisive.
- **Chronic osteomyelitis** – may be indistinguishable clinically; drug/RT history helps.
- **Recurrent tumour** (H&N SCC) – mass-like soft tissue, nodal disease, PET-avid tissue.
