## Terminology
- **Enthesis**: Insertion of tendon/ligament/joint capsule into bone ± adjacent fibrocartilage.
- **Enthesopathy**: Structural abnormalities at the enthesis (can be enthesitis (inflammatory) or mechanical, or degeneration)
- **Enthesitis**: Inflammatory change at the enthesis (hallmark feature of [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Joint/Inflammatory joint diseases/Seronegative Spondyloarthropathy/Spondyloarthropathy\|Spondyloarthropathy]]), subset of enthesopathy
- **Enthesophyte**: Bony spurs at insertion
	- Inflammatory (SpA-type): fluffy/ill-defined due to periostitis
	- Degenerative/mechanical: more sharply marginated along the line of pull.
---
## Clinical
- Localized pain and tenderness at enthesis.
- Worse with use; inflammatory types may have **morning stiffness**/**night pain**
- Common sites: 
	- Heel: Achilles, plantar fascia
	- Knee: patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon
	- Pelvis:
		- Hamstrings → ischial tuberosity
		- Adductors → pubis
		- Gluteal tendons→ greater trochanter
- Often coexists with other manifestations of [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Joint/Inflammatory joint diseases/Seronegative Spondyloarthropathy/Spondyloarthropathy\|SpA]]
	- [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Joint/By location/Sacroiliac/Sacroiliitis\|Sacroiliitis]]
	- Dactylitis
	- Peripheral arthritis

## Imaging Features
### X-ray
- Often **normal** early
- Later:
	- Peri-entheseal erosions
	- Periostitis (fluffy new bone formation)
	- Enthesophytes
	- ± Adjacent osteosclerosis
### Ultrasound
**General tendinopathy signs** at or just proximal to enthesis
- Thickening/fusiform enlargement
- Hypoechoic change (beware [[30_Rad Knowledge/Physics/Ultrasound/Anisotropy\|Anisotropy]] as a pitfall)
**Signs more specific to enthesitis**
- Increased Doppler signal at or just deep to the bony insertion.
- Bony changes: erosions, small enthesophytes.
- Adjacent bursitis or soft-tissue oedema
### MRI
- Oedema and enhancement at insertion ± adjacent bone marrow
- Subentheseal bone marrow oedema is very typical in [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Joint/Inflammatory joint diseases/Seronegative Spondyloarthropathy/Spondyloarthropathy\|SpA]]
- Associated findings:
	- Bursitis
	- Tendinopathy/partial tears
- Chronic findings:
	- Sclerosis
	- Fat metaplasia
	- Enthesophytes
	- Ankylosis (end-stage)

## Buzzwords
- “Bone proliferation at enthesis” → [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Joint/Inflammatory joint diseases/Seronegative Spondyloarthropathy/Spondyloarthropathy\|SpA]]-type enthesitis
- “Retrocalcaneal bursitis” → Achilles enthesitis
- “Osgood-Schlatter disease"
	- Traction apophysitis at tibial tuberosity → enthesopathy of patellar tendon origin
	- Typically adolescent, athletic, often self-limiting.
- “Hot heel sign”
	- MRI: bone marrow and soft-tissue oedema at Achilles/plantar fascia insertions.
	- Think inflammatory heel pain, esp. in axSpA
