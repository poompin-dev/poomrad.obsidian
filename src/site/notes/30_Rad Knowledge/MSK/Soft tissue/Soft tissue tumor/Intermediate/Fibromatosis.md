Benign (non-metastasising) **fibroblastic/myofibroblastic proliferation** that behaves like a “bad neighbour”: **infiltrative + locally aggressive + high local recurrence**.
___
## Imaging features
### General pattern
- **Mass-forming** soft-tissue lesion, often along **fascia/aponeuroses**
- **Encases** structures more than it destroys; may cause distortion/tethering
### Ultrasound
- Hypoechoic, solid, often ill-defined; variable vascularity
- "Clean" posterior acoustic shadowing
### CT
- Soft-tissue attenuation mass, variable margins
- Intra-abdominal desmoid may **encase mesenteric vessels/bowel** without frank invasion
### MRI
- T1: low–intermediate
- T2: **variable** (cellular = higher T2; collagenous = lower T2)
- Classic: **band-like low-signal strands** (collagen) on T2
- Enhancement: usually moderate–avid, often heterogeneous
- “**Fascial tail**” / aponeurotic extension can be seen (not exclusive)

## Main subtypes
- **Desmoid-type (deep fibromatosis)**: abdominal wall, mesentery, extra-abdominal (shoulder girdle, thigh, pelvic muscles)![Desmoid-type fibromatosis_1.png](/img/user/99_assets_Private/Desmoid-type%20fibromatosis_1.png)
- **Palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren)**: palmar aponeurosis → nodules/cords, finger flexion contracture

- **Plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose)**: medial plantar fascia nodules![Plantar fibromatosis_1.png](/img/user/99_assets_Private/Plantar%20fibromatosis_1.png)
- (Less exam-relevant but common): infantile/juvenile variants exist

## Top differentials
- **Fibrosis/scar**: usually non-masslike architectural distortion; stable/contractile; less “fascial tail” mass behaviour
- **Soft-tissue sarcoma**: tends to be more heterogeneous, necrosis/haemorrhage, more destructive; metastasis risk
- **Nodular fasciitis**: rapid growth, often more oedematous/high T2; self-limited; clinical history helps
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Soft tissue tumor/Sarcoma/Fibrosarcoma\|Fibrosarcoma]] / low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma**: imaging overlap → biopsy if atypical/growing
- **GIST/[[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Lymphoma\|lymphoma]]** (intra-abdominal mass): location and enhancement pattern; desmoid often wraps/encases rather than obstructs early
## Pearls
- **Key behaviour**: no metastases but **high recurrence**, can be morbid by encasement
- **Association**: **FAP/Gardner (APC)** → mesenteric desmoids (think post-op trigger)
- **MRI clue**: **low-signal collagen bands** within a variable T2 mass
- Interval growth vs stability (many are observed or treated non-operatively depending on site/symptoms)
