Malignant fibroblastic tumour producing collagen; **true adult-type fibrosarcoma is now very rare** (often a **diagnosis of exclusion** after modern IHC/molecular reclassification).
## Clinical
- Usually **painless, enlarging deep soft-tissue mass** (often extremities; thigh common)
- “Haematoma” history is a trap: **sarcomas can bleed**; lack of clear trauma or failure to regress is suspicious
___
## Imaging features
### MRI
- **T1:** low–intermediate (≈ muscle)
- **T2:** **variable** (cellular tumours can be high T2; **low T2/band-like low signal reflects collagen** and is **not specific**)
- **Enhancement:** solid, often heterogeneous; **nodular internal enhancement** = red flag vs haematoma
- **Margins/behaviour:** infiltrative or lobulated; may cross fascial planes; assess neurovascular relationship
- **Haemorrhage/necrosis:** can be present (don’t let fluid–fluid levels seduce you into “benign haematoma”)
### US / CT / radiograph
- Non-specific solid mass; CT mainly for extent, compartments, and staging work-up pathways
- Calcification/ossification is uncommon (if present, think alternative diagnosis or post-treatment change)
___
## Differential diagnoses
practically, the “modern reclassified” list
- **Myxofibrosarcoma** (often superficial, “tail sign” along fascia; frequently T2 bright myxoid areas)
- **[[Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma\|Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma]] (UPS)** (very heterogeneous, necrosis; diagnosis of exclusion)
- **Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS)** / **sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF)** (often deceptively bland; may show low-signal collagenous components)
- **Desmoid-type [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Soft tissue tumor/Intermediate/Fibromatosis\|fibromatosis]]** (benign but infiltrative; tends to encase rather than destroy; no metastases)
- **Chronic haematoma** (should evolve/regress; lacks solid nodular enhancement; GRE/SWI haemosiderin rim may support blood products)
___
## Pearls
- “Fibrosarcoma” used to be a common label; now **most are reclassified** → be cautious naming it on imaging alone
- Separate entity: **infantile fibrosarcoma** (paeds; often extremity; classically ETV6–NTRK3 fusion)
