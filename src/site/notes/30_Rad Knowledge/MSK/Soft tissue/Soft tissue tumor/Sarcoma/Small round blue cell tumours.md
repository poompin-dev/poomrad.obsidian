## Concept
- **Pattern**, not a diagnosis: malignant tumours composed of **small, round, dark “blue” cells** with scant cytoplasm and high N:C ratio.
- Strongly associated with **paediatric / young adult** malignancies.
- On H&E alone they look similar → need **immunohistochemistry + molecular** to subtype.
- Think **“SRBCT club”** and then narrow by **age + site + imaging behaviour**.

> [!Mental summary]
> SRBCT = “this looks like a primitive paediatric malignancy”; final label depends on **where it is** and **what markers/genetics show**.

## Main SRBCT Entities

- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Neuroblastoma\|Neuroblastoma]]**
  - Age: infant / young child.
  - Site: **adrenal / sympathetic chain**.
  - Imaging: calcified suprarenal mass, vessel encasement, crosses midline, bone/marrow mets.

- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Ewing sarcoma\|Ewing sarcoma]] / PNET**
  - Age: child / teen.
  - Site: **diaphyseal long bones, pelvis, ribs**, chest wall ([[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Askin\|Askin]]).
  - Imaging: aggressive permeative bone lesion, onion-skin periosteal reaction, large soft-tissue component.

- **Rhabdomyosarcoma (alveolar/embryonal)**
  - Age: child / adolescent.
  - Site: **head & neck (parameningeal), orbit, GU tract, extremity**.
  - Imaging: soft-tissue mass, often crossing fascial planes; may cause bone erosion but not primarily osseous.

- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Renal masses/Wilms tumour\|Wilms tumour]] (blastemal component)**
  - Age: young child.
  - Site: **kidney**.
  - Imaging: large intrarenal mass with claw sign; calcification less common than neuroblastoma.

- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Lymphoma/Lymphoma\|Lymphoma]]**
  - Any age, but SRBCT look especially in kids/teens.
  - Site: nodes, abdominal mass, bone.
  - Imaging: homogeneous soft-tissue mass, tends to **encase rather than invade** vessels; often multi-station nodal disease.

- **Desmoplastic small round cell tumour (DSRCT)**
  - Age: adolescent / young adult male.
  - Site: **peritoneal surfaces, pelvis**.
  - Imaging: multiple peritoneal/omental masses, often with ascites; primary organ not obvious.

- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Medulloblastoma\|Medulloblastoma]]**
  - Age: child.
  - Site: **posterior fossa (midline vermis)**.
  - Imaging: hyperdense posterior fossa mass, often restricting diffusion.

## How to Use “SRBCT” in Exams

> [!tip]
> When you see “small round blue cell tumour”, **don’t freeze** – immediately anchor:
> - **Age** (infant, child, teen, young adult)
> - **Primary site**
> - **Bone vs soft tissue vs organ vs CNS**

Then default patterns:
- **Adrenal / paraspinal infant** → neuroblastoma.  
- **Diaphyseal bone / chest wall teen** → Ewing/Askin.  
- **Big intrarenal mass child** → Wilms.  
- **Parameningeal/orbit child** → rhabdomyosarcoma.  
- **Peritoneal masses teen male** → DSRCT.  
- **Posterior fossa mass child** → medulloblastoma.
