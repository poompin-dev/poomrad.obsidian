Most widely used **histologic grading system** for **adult-type soft tissue sarcomas** in Europe (and many MDTs globally).  
Used for **prognosis, treatment planning, and AJCC staging**.

> Practical rule: **mainly for adult, non–paediatric small round blue cell STS**.  
> Not normally applied to paediatric [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Soft tissue tumor/Sarcoma/Small round blue cell tumours\|SRBCT]]s (Ewing, alveolar RMS, DSRCT) or some special entities.

## FNCLCC grading components

| Parameter                   | Score 1                                                                              | Score 2                                                                            | Score 3                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tumour differentiation**  | Sarcoma closely resembling normal adult mesenchymal tissue / **well differentiated** | Certain line of differentiation but less obvious, **intermediate differentiation** | **Poorly differentiated** or **undifferentiated sarcoma** |
| **Mitotic count** (/10 HPF) | 0–9 mitoses                                                                          | 10–19 mitoses                                                                      | ≥20 mitoses                                               |
| **Tumour necrosis**         | <50% tumour necrosis                                                                 | ≥50% tumour necrosis                                                               | -                                                         |

> HPF = standard ×40 objective; actual area is lab-dependent, but for exams just use the cut-offs.

## Total Score and Grade

| Total FNCLCC score | FNCLCC Grade |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| **2–3**            | Grade 1      |
| **4–5**            | Grade 2      |
| **6–8**            | Grade 3      |

---
## Clinical Relevance
- **Grade 3**:  
	- High risk of **metastasis** (classically lung) and poorer overall survival.  
- **Grade is an independent prognostic factor**, often more important than size alone.
- Incorporated into **AJCC staging** and influences:
	- Decision for **adjuvant radiotherapy / chemotherapy**.
	- Intensity of **follow-up**.

## Caution / Exceptions

FNCLCC grading is **not usually used / not very helpful** for:

- **GIST** → use NIH/AFIP-type **risk stratification** (size, mitoses, site, rupture).
- **Rhabdomyosarcoma (paediatric)** → own paediatric risk systems (histologic subtype + stage).
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Ewing sarcoma\|Ewing sarcoma]] / PNET and other [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Soft tissue tumor/Sarcoma/Small round blue cell tumours\|small round blue cell tumours]]** → generally treated as **high-grade by definition**.
- Some “special” sarcomas where grading adds little:
	- **Angiosarcoma**, clear cell sarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, etc.
