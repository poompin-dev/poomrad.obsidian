Rare, **congenital, non-hereditary [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Malformation/Focal gigantism\|localised gigantism]]** due to **disproportionate fibrofatty overgrowth** of soft tissues ± bone, typically along a **nerve territory** (e.g. median nerve in hand, plantar nerves in foot). Often presents as macrodactyly.

---
## Key clinical points
- Present at birth or early childhood; **progressive** overgrowth.
- Common sites: **2nd–3rd digits of hand/foot**, median or plantar nerve distribution.
- Usually **unilateral**, segmental; no systemic features (distinguish from overgrowth syndromes).

---
## Imaging features

### Radiograph
- **Enlarged digits** with:
	- Marked **soft tissue overgrowth** (predominantly radiolucent → fat).
	- **Bony hypertrophy**: enlarged, elongated phalanges/metacarpals/metatarsals.
	- Cortical thickening ± mild deformity.
- Joint spaces usually preserved.

### Ultrasound
- Increased bulk of **echogenic fat** in subcutaneous and intermuscular planes.
- Enlarged nerve with **hyperechoic epineurium** and thickened fascicles if lipofibromatous hamartoma coexists.

### MRI (most characteristic)

> [!summary]
> Think: **massive fat overgrowth in a nerve territory** with otherwise normal marrow.

- Dominant component = **fat signal**:
	- High T1 / high T2, **suppressed on fat-sat**.
- Interspersed **fibrous strands / septa**: low T1, low–intermediate T2.
- Follows **nerve distribution** (e.g. along median nerve in the carpal tunnel).
- Bone:
	- Enlarged size, normal marrow signal.
- If associated **fibrolipomatous hamartoma of nerve**:
	- **“Coaxial cable / spaghetti”** appearance of enlarged nerve with fat interdigitating between fascicles.

CT is rarely needed but shows hypertrophic bone + low attenuation fat proliferation.

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[30_Rad Knowledge/Multisystem/Neoplasms/Tumor predisposition syndromes/Proteus syndrome\|Proteus syndrome]]           | Asymmetric overgrowth + dysregulated bone, vascular malformations, cerebriform plantar nevi, systemic features.     |
| [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Malformation/Klippel-Trénaunay Syndrome\|Klippel-Trénaunay Syndrome]] | Limb overgrowth + **port-wine stain + venous/lymphatic malformations**, not pure fat overgrowth in nerve territory. |
| Plexiform neurofibroma         | “Bag of worms” soft tissue mass, not predominantly fat; NF1 stigmata.                                               |
| Haemangioma / AVM              | Vascular channels, flow voids, phleboliths; not uniform fatty bulk.                                                 |
| Isolated lipomatosis           | Diffuse fat overgrowth but lacks **nerve-territory pattern** and bony hypertrophy.                                  |
