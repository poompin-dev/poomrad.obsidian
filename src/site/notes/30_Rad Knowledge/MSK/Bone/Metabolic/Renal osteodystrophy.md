Chronic kidney disease–related **metabolic bone disease** with a *mixture* of:
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteomalacia\|Osteomalacia]] / [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteoporosis/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]]  
- Secondary / tertiary [[hyperparathyroidism\|hyperparathyroidism]] (high bone turnover)  
- +/- osteosclerosis and soft-tissue / vascular calcification  

→ Characteristically **generalised** bone involvement in a patient with CKD/dialysis.

---
## Pathophysiology

- ↓ GFR → phosphate retention → ↓ 1,25(OH)₂D → hypocalcaemia → **secondary hyperparathyroidism**
- Long-standing disease ± post-transplant:
	- **High-turnover**: osteitis fibrosa cystica (PTH-driven)
	- **Low-turnover**: osteomalacia, adynamic bone disease (over-suppressed PTH, aluminium, diabetes, steroids)
- Net result: abnormal bone remodelling + mineralisation + extraskeletal calcification

## Imaging features

> [!summary]
> Think: **generalised bone disease in CKD** with  
> 1) osteopenia/osteomalacia  
> 2) subperiosteal resorption / brown tumours  
> 3) patchy osteosclerosis + soft-tissue/vascular calcification.

### Plain radiograph

#### General
- **Diffuse osteopenia / osteomalacia**
- Coarse trabeculae, cortical thinning
- Looser zones / insufficiency fractures (esp. femoral neck, pubic rami, ribs)

#### Skull
- **“Salt-and-pepper” skull**  
  - Coarse, granular appearance from trabecular resorption & patchy sclerosis  
  - Loss of normal sharp inner/outer table definition

#### Hands & long bones
- **Subperiosteal bone resorption** (hallmark of hyperparathyroidism):
	- Classically **radial aspects of middle phalanges** of index/middle fingers
	- May see acro-osteolysis of distal phalanges
- Endosteal resorption → cortical irregularity, lace-like appearance
- Brown tumours: expansile lytic lesions ± cortical thinning, may mimic giant cell tumour / metastasis

#### Spine
- **Rugger-jersey spine**:
	- Sclerosis of vertebral endplates with relatively lucent central portion
	- Symmetric, multiple levels
- Vertebral osteopenia ± biconcave “codfish” vertebrae

#### Pelvis / hips
- Mixed picture:
	- Osteopenia + insufficiency fractures
	- Patchy osteosclerosis (pelvic bones, proximal femora)
- Brown tumours in pelvis, ribs

#### Soft tissues
- **Vascular calcification** (medial calcification, “pipe-stem” arteries)
- **Periarticular / soft-tissue calcifications**, possibly **tumoral calcinosis**:
	- Lobulated, amorphous periarticular calcified masses (often around hips, shoulders, elbows)

---
### CT

- Better delineation of:
	- Brown tumours (expansile lytic lesions with internal matrix, thin cortex)
	- Extent of cortical resorption and fractures
	- Vascular and periarticular **calcification burden**
- Rugger-jersey spine and patchy osteosclerosis conspicuous on bone windows

---
### MRI
- Brown tumours:
	- Typically **low–intermediate T1**, variable T2, often enhance
	- Can be heterogeneous if haemorrhage / fibrosis
- Marrow:
	- Heterogeneous signal from remodelling, fibrosis, anaemia
- Fractures and insufficiency injuries more sensitive on MRI than radiographs

---
### Nuclear medicine

- **Bone scan**:
	- Often **“superscan”** pattern:
		- Intense, diffuse skeletal uptake
		- Markedly reduced renal and soft-tissue activity (but kidneys may still show some activity in CKD)
	- Focally increased uptake in fractures and brown tumours
- Useful to assess **disease extent** and **fracture risk**, not specific to renal aetiology → correlate with CKD history.

---
## Patterns by pathology

### High-turnover disease
(osteitis fibrosa cystica; usually secondary/tertiary HPT)
- Imaging:
	- Subperiosteal resorption (phalanges, distal clavicles, ribs)
	- Brown tumours
	- Salt-and-pepper skull
	- Rugger-jersey spine
- Labs (for correlation): high PTH, high ALP, variable Ca/PO₄ depending on treatment.

### Low-turnover disease 
(osteomalacia, adynamic bone disease)
- Imaging:
	- Diffuse osteopenia
	- Looser zones / pseudofractures
	- Fewer overt resorptive lesions
- Often in heavily treated / post-transplant / diabetic / elderly CKD patients.

### Mixed disease
- Common in real life: features of both high- and low-turnover in the same patient.

## Key differentials

| Feature              | Paget disease                              | Renal osteodystrophy                         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Distribution        | **Focal**, often asymmetric, polyostotic    | **Generalised, diffuse**                     |
| Bone size           | Bone enlargement, deformity, bowing        | Usually normal size, but osteopenic/sclerotic|
| Cortex              | Thickened, coarse trabeculae               | Thinned or irregular from resorption         |
| Skull               | Cotton wool patches                         | Salt-and-pepper, granularity                 |
## Exam nuggets & buzzwords

> [!summary]
> **Buzzwords**:  
> - Salt-and-pepper skull  
> - Rugger-jersey spine  
> - Subperiosteal resorption (radial phalangeal sides)  
> - Brown tumours  
> - Superscan in a dialysis patient  
> - Extensive vascular & periarticular calcification.

- Typical patient: **long-standing CKD / dialysis**, bone pain, fractures, high PTH.
- **Rugger-jersey spine**: symmetric endplate sclerosis (superior & inferior), mid-vertebral lucency.
- **Salt-and-pepper skull**: granular calvarium with loss of normal cortical definition.
- **Subperiosteal resorption**:
	- Radial aspects of finger phalanges (classic)
	- Distal clavicles, ribs, pelvis
- **Tumoral calcinosis** pattern around large joints is very exam-friendly in CKD context.
