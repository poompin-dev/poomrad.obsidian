## Aetiology

> [!summary]
> Think: **vitamin D**, **phosphate**, **renal**, **drugs**, **rare tumour / genetic**.

- ↓ Vitamin D:
	- Nutritional deficiency, low sunlight exposure
	- Malabsorption (coeliac, IBD, bariatric surgery)
	- Cholestatic liver disease (↓ bile salts → impaired Vit D absorption)
- Renal:
	- CKD with phosphate retention, ↓ 1α-hydroxylase → ↓ active Vit D (overlaps with renal osteodystrophy)
- Phosphate-wasting:
	- Tumour-induced osteomalacia
	- Hereditary hypophosphataemic rickets/osteomalacia
	- Fanconi syndrome (proximal RTA)
- Drugs:
	- Anticonvulsants (enzyme-inducing → ↑ Vit D metabolism)
	- Long-term anticonvulsants / antiresorptives can predispose to insufficiency fractures

---
## Pathophysiology

- Normal osteoid formation but **impaired mineralisation** (↓ Ca/PO₄, or both).
	- Bone becomes **soft** → deformity + microfractures:
	- Insufficiency fractures → **Looser zones**
	- Bone pain, muscle weakness, waddling gait
- Biochemically often:
	- ↑ ALP, low/normal Ca, low/normal PO₄ (pattern depends on cause)
	- Abnormal Vit D / PTH.

## Imaging

> [!summary]
> Main imaging pattern = **generalised osteopenia** + **Looser zones** ± deformity.  
> Early disease can be normal on radiographs.

### Plain radiographs

#### General features
- **Diffuse osteopenia**:
	- Thinned cortices
	- Coarser, sparse trabeculae
- Bones may appear “washed out”
- Deformities in long-standing cases:
	- Bowing of long bones
	- Biconcave “codfish” vertebrae
	- Pelvic deformity (e.g. protrusio acetabuli)

#### Looser zones (pseudofractures) – key sign
- Short, **transverse or oblique lucent lines**, usually:
	- Perpendicular to the cortex
	- Do **not** extend fully across bone
	- Often with **sclerotic margins**
- Represent **incomplete insufficiency fractures** through unmineralised osteoid.
- Classic locations:
	- Medial femoral neck
	- Pubic rami
	- Lateral scapula
	- Ribs (axillary margins)
	- Medial aspect of proximal femur / femoral shaft
	- Ulna, fibula
- Often **bilateral and symmetric**.

#### Spine
- Generalised vertebral osteopenia
- Biconcave “codfish” vertebrae (endplate concavity)
- Insufficiency fractures (wedge/compression) in severe disease.

#### Pelvis and lower limbs
- Osteopenia + Looser zones in pubic rami, femoral neck, sacrum
- Long-standing disease:
	- Coxa profunda / protrusio acetabuli
	- Bowing deformity of long bones (esp. femur, tibia).

#### Skull
- Usually less dramatically involved than in hyperparathyroidism:
	- Osteopenia, loss of sharp trabeculae
	- No classic salt-and-pepper pattern.

### CT
- More sensitive for:
	- Insufficiency fractures and Looser zones
	- Cortical thinning and subtle deformity
- Helps exclude other focal lesions (e.g. metastasis) when Looser zones are atypical.

---
### MRI
- **Looser zones / insufficiency fractures**:
	- Linear low-signal line on T1, with surrounding high T2/STIR oedema
	- Enhancement of fracture line and adjacent bone marrow after contrast
- Non-specific marrow signal changes from osteopenia and microfractures.
- Very sensitive for early insufficiency fractures when X-ray still normal.

---
### Nuclear medicine (bone scan)

> [!tip]
> Classic: **hot Looser zones** in a background of increased general bone turnover.

- **Increased uptake** along Looser zones (linear, symmetric, often multiple)
- Generalised increased skeletally uptake possible (high turnover osteomalacia)
- Very sensitive to detect number and distribution of pseudofractures.

## Key differentials

### Osteomalacia vs osteoporosis

| Feature              | Osteomalacia                                      | Osteoporosis                                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Core problem        | **Defective mineralisation** of osteoid          | **Reduced quantity of normal bone**             |
| Lab tests           | Often abnormal (Vit D, Ca/PO₄, ↑ ALP, ± PTH)     | Usually normal biochemistry                     |
| Radiographs         | Osteopenia + **Looser zones**, deformity         | Osteopenia; **no Looser zones**                 |
| Vertebral changes   | Codfish vertebrae, fractures                      | Wedge/compression fractures common              |
| Bone pain           | Diffuse bone pain, proximal myopathy             | Often asymptomatic until fracture               |

**Exam hook:** presence of **Looser zones + biochemical abnormalities** → favour osteomalacia over simple osteoporosis.

### Osteomalacia vs renal osteodystrophy

| Feature                  | Osteomalacia                                   | Renal osteodystrophy                             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Clinical context        | Various causes, not necessarily CKD           | **CKD/dialysis** almost always present           |
| Key imaging sign        | Looser zones, osteopenia                      | ROD pattern: **subperiosteal resorption**, rugger-jersey spine, salt-and-pepper skull, soft-tissue calcifications |
| Vascular calcification  | Not prominent                                  | **Very common** (vascular & periarticular)      |
| Brown tumours           | No                                            | Can be present (secondary/tertiary HPT)         |

Remember: renal osteodystrophy often includes a **low-turnover osteomalacia component**, so overlap exists.

## Exam nuggets

> [!summary]
> **Buzzwords**:  
> - Generalised osteopenia  
> - **Looser zones / pseudofractures**  
> - Insufficiency fractures (pelvis, femoral neck, ribs)  
> - Bone pain, proximal myopathy, Vit D deficiency / phosphate wasting.

- Typical patient:
	- Adult with **bone pain, muscle weakness**, difficulty walking
	- Low Vit D or phosphate-wasting disorder.
- **Looser zones**:
	- Incomplete, transverse lucencies with sclerotic margins
	- Bilateral and symmetric, classic in **medial femoral neck, pubic rami, ribs**.
- **Bone scan**:
	- Markedly increased uptake in pseudofractures.
- Early disease:
	- Radiographs can be normal → bone scan or MRI may show changes earlier.
- Tumour-induced osteomalacia:
	- Consider when severe osteomalacia + **isolated hypophosphataemia** + high FGF23
	- Small mesenchymal tumours (often extremities, craniofacial); role for whole-body MRI / PET in localisation.
