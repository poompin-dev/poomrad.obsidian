## Overview
- In popular usage, **“osteoporosis” usually refers to [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteoporosis/Primary generalised osteoporosis\|primary generalised osteoporosis]]** (postmenopausal / senile), although strictly it also includes [[secondary generalised osteoporosis\|secondary generalised osteoporosis]].
- Formally, osteoporosis is characterised by **reduced bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration**, leading to increased bone fragility and fracture risk.
	- The distinction from [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteomalacia\|osteomalacia]] is that osteoporosis has **normal mineralisation of the bone matrix** (reduced quantity of normally mineralised bone), whereas osteomalacia has defective mineralisation.
- On imaging, it **radiographically presents as [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteoporosis/Osteopenia\|osteopenia]]** once bone mineral loss reaches roughly **30–50%**:
    - Plain radiograph/CT can only detect **late or severe** changes.
    - [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteoporosis/Osteopenia\|Osteopenia]] has a broad differential → we **should not report “osteoporosis” from plain radiograph alone** without clinical/DXA correlation.
## Classification
- **Generalised**

    - [[Complex regional pain syndrome\|Complex regional pain syndrome]]
    - Transient regional osteoporosis
        - [[Transient osteoporosis of the hip\|Transient osteoporosis of the hip]]
        - [[Regional migratory osteoporosis\|Regional migratory osteoporosis]]
- **Localised**
    - Focal disuse (immobilisation, paralysis)
    - Secondary to hyperemia:
