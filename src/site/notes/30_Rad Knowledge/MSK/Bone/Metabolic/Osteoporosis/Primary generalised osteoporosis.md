The most prevalent metabolic bone disease and a leading cause of [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Insufficiency fracture\|insufficiency fracture]] / [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Special fracture/Fragility fracture\|fragility fracture]] → fractures of the proximal femur have a major impact on the quality of life of both patients and caregivers.
## Biology
- Peak bone mass is achieved in the **late teens to early 3rd decade**; males > females; Black > other races.
- After peak bone mass, bone mass **gradually decreases with age** in all populations:
    - In women, loss accelerates after the **4th–5th decade** (post-menopause).
    - In men, loss starts later (around the 5th decade) and is more gradual.
    - A similarly sharp fall in bone mass is seen earlier in women with bilateral oophorectomy, athletes with secondary amenorrhoea, hyperprolactinaemia, and Turner syndrome.
    - Comparable bone loss can also occur in men with hypogonadism.
    - These observations support a major role of **sex hormones (oestrogen, testosterone)** in preserving bone density.
- Beyond sex hormones, age-related generalised bone loss is **multifactorial and not fully explained by routine laboratory tests**. Conventional lab results are typically normal.
- Both **trabecular (more severe)** and **cortical** bone loss occur and contribute to increased risk of [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Insufficiency fracture\|insufficiency fracture]]:
    - **Trabecular bone loss** → ↑ [[vertebral insufficiency fracture\|vertebral insufficiency fracture]], distal radius fractures.
    - **Cortical bone loss** → ↑ proximal femur fractures.
## Clinical
- Often asymptomatic until fracture.
- Back pain due to:
    - [[Vertebral insufficiency fracture\|Vertebral insufficiency fracture]] →
        - Height loss
        - Increased thoracic kyphosis (ddx senile kyphosis)
        - Usually **no** neurological complications
    - Pelvic and sacral fractures
- Atraumatic or fragility fractures of ribs, proximal femur, humerus, radius.
## Diagnosis
- Normal bone mineralisation but **reduced bone density** compared with individuals of the same sex and race, with or without evidence of [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Insufficiency fracture\|insufficiency fracture]].
- For technical details and diagnostic criteria → see [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteoporosis/DXA scan for osteoporosis\|DXA scan for osteoporosis]].
- Various other methods to measure bone mineral density are being investigated but are not standard practice.

## Radiological findings
- Changes predominate in the **axial skeleton** and **proximal portions of long bones** of the appendicular skeleton.
- **Expansion of the medullary cavity** at the expense of cortical thickness due to greater increase in endosteal diameter than periosteal diameter.
- Reduction of trabecular bone (some trabeculae are thinned, others lost) → accentuation/unmasking of remaining trabecular patterns:
    - **Vertebral bodies:** accentuated vertical striations (can simulate the appearance of a vertebral haemangioma)
        - Due to preferential resorption of the horizontal trabeculae.
    - **Proximal femur:** more prominent Ward’s triangle; basis of the [[Singh index\|Singh index]].
- Linear or band-like sclerosis oriented perpendicular to the long axis of long bones in periarticular regions = **“reinforcement lines” / “bone bars”**
    - Due to remodelling of trabecular bone.
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Insufficiency fracture\|Insufficiency fracture]] typical sites by frequency:
    - [[Vertebral insufficiency fracture\|Vertebral insufficiency fracture]]
    - Symphysis pubis, pubic rami, sacrum
    - Other regions of the bony pelvis, femoral neck, proximal and distal tibia, sternum
