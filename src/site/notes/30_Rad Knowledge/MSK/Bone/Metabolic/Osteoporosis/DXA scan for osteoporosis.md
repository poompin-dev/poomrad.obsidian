Currently the **standardised method** for screening for and diagnosing **generalised osteoporosis**.
## Principle
- Measures **bone mineral density (BMD)** using **dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)**.
- Two X-ray energies are used to distinguish bone (calcium-rich) from soft tissue in the region of interest.
- The measured BMD is **compared with a reference population** of the same sex (and usually race) to generate **T- and Z-scores**.
## Diagnostic criteria

> [!important] WHO criteria  
> Based on **T-score** (standard deviation from young adult peak bone mass, same sex ± race):
> 
> - **Normal:** T-score ≥ −1.0
>     
> - **Osteopenia:** −1.0 > T-score > −2.5
>     
> - **Osteoporosis:** T-score ≤ −2.5
>     
> - **Severe (established) osteoporosis:** T-score ≤ −2.5 **plus** a typical [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Insufficiency fracture\|insufficiency fracture]] / [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Special fracture/Fragility fracture\|fragility fracture]]
>     

Since these criteria were developed for **primary generalised osteoporosis**, they are applied mainly to specific risk groups according to guidelines (e.g. postmenopausal women and older men).

For **younger patients** (often with **secondary generalised osteoporosis**), the **Z-score** (deviation from normal BMD compared with the same race, sex, and **age**) is used instead.

- **Z-score < −2.0** is reported as **“below the expected range for age”**, but this alone is **not** a formal diagnosis of osteoporosis and must be interpreted in clinical context.

## Where to measure?

Most centres measure **lumbar spine** and **hip**, and use the **lowest T-score** of these sites for diagnosis.
### Spine
- Primary site because generalised primary osteoporosis **predominantly affects the axial skeleton**.
- Use **L1–L4** vertebrae.
**When to exclude a specific lumbar level?** → Artefacts that corrupt the BMD measurement, e.g.:
- Abdominal vascular calcification
- Marked lumbar degenerative change (large osteophytes, disc degeneration)
- Post-operative change: spinal fixation, vertebroplasty, etc.
- A vertebra whose T-score differs by **>1.0** from the **mean of the adjacent two levels** (often falsely high from degenerative changes)
**When to exclude spine measurement entirely?**
- When **fewer than two contiguous vertebrae** remain usable (cannot calculate a reliable L1–L4 mean).

Also assess vertebral morphology:
- Look for **vertebral deformity / collapse** → a [[vertebral insufficiency fracture\|vertebral insufficiency fracture]] both **confirms severe osteoporosis** (when T-score ≤ −2.5) and indicates a higher risk of future insufficiency fractures, especially of the hip.
### Hip
- Primary alternative site when spine measurement is unusable or unreliable.
- **Left hip** is measured by convention, but either hip can be used; if both are measured, the **lower T-score** is reported.

**When to avoid a given hip side?** → Artefacts or pathology affecting BMD:
- Severe hip osteoarthritis or deformity
- Post-operative changes (arthroplasty, ORIF hardware, etc.)
### Distal 33% non-dominant radius
- Optional site, but emphasised in certain **secondary generalised osteoporosis** where **appendicular skeleton involvement predominates** (e.g. hypercortisolism, hyperparathyroidism, some CKD/mineral bone disorders).
