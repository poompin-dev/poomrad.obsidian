## Overview

The term literally means **“poverty of bone”**.  
In radiology, it is a **non-specific imaging finding**, seen on radiograph or CT as **decreased bone density** (do **not** confuse this with the WHO densitometric term “osteopenia” used in [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteoporosis/DXA scan for osteoporosis\|DXA criteria]]).

It is a **preferred descriptive term** to use in reports instead of older or less precise words (e.g. _demineralisation_, _undermineralisation_, _deossification_), and instead of labelling a patient with **osteoporosis**, which has stricter diagnostic criteria (DXA, clinical fractures, etc.).

> (You can mentally keep: “Radiographic osteopenia ≠ DXA ‘osteopenia’ (T-score −1 to −2.5)”.)
