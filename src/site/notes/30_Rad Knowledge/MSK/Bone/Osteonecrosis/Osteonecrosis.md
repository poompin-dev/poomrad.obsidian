## Pathophysiology
Blood supply disruption → hypoxic cellular injury → inflammatory reactions → irreversible damage → complications

Multiple cell types within the marrow response differently to hypoxic injury. The usual sequence of cell death is haematologic stem cells (red marrow) → osteocytes/clasts/blasts→ fatty marrow.
### Typical location
**Location within the bone**
Long axis: Juxtaarticular/epiphysis >> metadiaphyseal
- Juxtaarticular subchondral bone has relatively poor collateral supply because articular cartilage is avascular and epiphyseal vessels are end-arteries.
- Epiphysis has less collateral circulation (esp. in skeletal immature where growth plate block vessel from metaphysis)
Axial axis: cancellous bone >>>> cortical bone
- Cortical bone gets extensive blood supply from periosteal artery and intramedullary artery

**Location within the body**
Appendicular > Axial
 - Hematopoietic activity in axial bones act as protective factor (except in sickle cell disease where red marrow itself is the problem)
### Zone
- **Necrotic zone**
	- Irreversible cell death (osteocytes + marrow)
	- Trabecular mineralisation initially preserved → appears relatively sclerotic compared with surrounding hyperaemic, osteopenic bone.
	- Later partial resorption → mixed lytic-sclerotic appearance.
- **Ischaemic zone**
	- Potentially reversible hypoxic cellular injury (chemical and enzymatic alteration)
	- Borderline zone that produce inflammatory signals causing hyperemia in the next zone
- **Hyperaemia zone**
	- Active response to ischaemic injury
	- Creeping substitution at the interface between necrotic and viable bone produces a serpiginous line "bone-on-bone" sclerotic rim
	- Correlate with "double line sign" seen on fluid sensitive signal
		- Outer low-signal = sclerotic bone
		- Inner high-signal = granulation tissue
- **Normal tissue**
	- Can look relatively radiolucent due to hyperemia → increased osteoclast resorption

## Causes
### Post-traumatic
Acute physical disruption of blood supply 
- Femoral head
	- Most blood supply = retinacular branches of medial femoral circumflex artery (usually from deep femoral artery) running in the posterosuperior neck → vulnerable in intracapsular fractures (subcapital, transcervical)
	- [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Osteonecrosis/Grading of osteonecrosis of femoral head\|Grading of osteonecrosis of femoral head]] can help guide management according to extension of damage
	- "crescent sign" = subchondral radiolucency parallel to articular surface
- Talus
	- Mostly involve body
	- "Hawkins sign" = radiolucent area appearing at 6-8 weeks post fracture; represent viable bone (good prognosis), absence = worry for AVN
- Scaphoid
	- Mostly involve proximal pole (due to retrograde flow)
- Capitate
	- Involve in scaphocapitate syndrome
- Spine
	- Kümmel disease: delayed anterior wedge collapse of vertebral body after minor trauma
		- can see "vacuum cleft sign" within the vertebral body
### Primary (Spontaneous)
#### Chandler disease
- Involve femoral head
- Segmental subtype is less severe and non-progressive
#### Ahlbäck disease
- = SONK; now considered a rare entity since most cases are actually [[SIFK\|SIFK]]
#### Muller-Weiss syndrome
- Involve navicular
- Commonly bilateral
- "Comma" sign
- Progressive pain, deformity, disability
### Dysbariatic
= Caisson disease; happens when supersaturated nitrogen got liberated during rapid decompression and forms emboli in various sites of the body including bone marrow
- Can involve metadiaphyseal location (ddx = enostoses)
- Typical sites: femoral head, distal femur, proximal tibia, humeral head
### Others
- Hypercortisolism (iatrogenic, Cushing disease)
- Radiation
- Sickle cell anemia and other haemoglobinopathies
- Gaucher disease
- Chronic alcohol abuse
- Transplantation
- Coagulopathies
## Complications
- Juxtaarticular
	- Collapse of articular surface → secondary OA
	- Intraarticular osseous bodies
- Metadiaphyseal
	- Benign cystic change
		- Endosteal scalloping without cortical breach
		- No associated soft tissue mass
	- Malignant transformation ([[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Soft tissue tumor/Sarcoma/Fibrosarcoma\|Fibrosarcoma]], [[UPS\|UPS]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Osteosarcoma\|Osteosarcoma]])
		- Very rare unpreventable complication with abysmal prognosis
		- Ddx with benign cystic change due to same location
		- Features suggestive of malignancy include a soft tissue mass, aggressive periosteal reaction, and cortical/osseous destruction
