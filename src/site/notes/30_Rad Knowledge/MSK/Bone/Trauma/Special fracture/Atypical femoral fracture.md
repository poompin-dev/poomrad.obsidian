## Definition
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Insufficiency fracture\|Insufficiency fracture]] of femoral shaft or subtrochanteric region
- Strongly associated with long-term [[Bisphosphonates\|Bisphosphonates]] or other potent antiresorptive therapy
- Diagnostic criteria are according to the **ASBMR task force**
## Major Criteria (radiographic; typically ≥4 of 5)
- **Location:** Femur subtrochanteric or diaphyseal (shaft) region
- **Pattern:** Transverse or short oblique fracture
- **Trauma:** Occurs with minimal or no trauma
- **Fracture morphology:** Simple (no/minimal comminution)
- Complete fractures often have a **medial spike**
## Minor Criteria (supportive)
- Cortical thickening/beaking (especially lateral cortex)
- Periosteal reaction of the lateral cortex
- Prior prolonged aching pain (prodrome)
- Bilateral involvement or delayed healing
- Drug history: **bisphosphonates or other antiresorptives**, chronic steroids, PPIs
## Clinical Points
- Dull thigh/groin pain may precede fracture (prodrome)
- Commonly delayed union or non-union
- Review and usually stop bisphosphonate (or other antiresorptive) therapy if AFF is diagnosed
- Early surgical fixation even for incomplete fractures (usually prophylactic for contralateral site)

## Differential diagnosis

| Differential                          | Typical Location                        | Clinical Context                             | Fracture Pattern                                    | Key Distinguishing Features                           |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Osteoporotic Fracture**             | Femoral neck, intertrochanteric         | Elderly, fall/low trauma                     | Comminuted, spiral/oblique                          | Not diaphyseal/subtrochanteric; comminuted            |
| **Femoral shaft [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Stress fracture\|stress fracture]]** | Shaft (often medial/compressive cortex) | Athletes, overuse                            | Incomplete, variable                                | Medial cortex; No long term history of antiresorptive |
| **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Pathological fracture\|Pathological fracture]]**         | Any location                            | Primary bone tumour, metastasis, infection   | Any (often destructive without clear fracture line) | Lytic/blastic lesion, mass, abnormal marrow           |
| **Traumatic Fracture**                | Any femoral region                      | High-energy trauma                           | Comminuted, segmental                               | Clear history of significant trauma                   |
| **Other Metabolic Bone Disease**      | Variable                                | [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteomalacia\|Osteomalacia]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Misc/Paget disease\|Paget disease]], [[HPT\|HPT]] | Variable                                            | Lab/radiology findings of metabolic disease           |

## Checklist
- Look for lateral cortical beaking/thickening (may precede fracture)
- Incomplete (“crack”/stress reaction) or complete fractures
- Simple, non-comminuted fracture
- Always check **both femurs** 
## Caution
- **Don’t overcall AFF:** Reserve this diagnosis for cases meeting the major criteria, **typically in the setting of long-term bisphosphonate or other antiresorptive therapy.**
- **Don’t miss a tumour:** If radiological pattern or clinical course is atypical, investigate for underlying lesion.
