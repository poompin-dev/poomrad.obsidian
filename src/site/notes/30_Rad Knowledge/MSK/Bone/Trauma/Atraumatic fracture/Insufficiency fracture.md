## Core concept
Fracture due to **normal physiological load on abnormally weakened bone**, i.e. a subtype of [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Stress fracture\|stress fracture]] occurring in **abnormal bone**.

> [!summary]
> Think: **elderly / metabolic bone disease + “no proper trauma” + pelvis / sacrum / tibial plateau** → call it **insufficiency fracture** until proven otherwise.
## Aetiology / risk factors
Bone is structurally weakened by:
- **Generalised**:
	- Generalized **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteoporosis/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]]**
	- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Osteomalacia\|Osteomalacia]]**, vitamin D deficiency
	- Chronic inflammatory joint disease (e.g. **RA**, [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Joint/Inflammatory joint diseases/Seronegative Spondyloarthropathy/Spondyloarthropathy\|seronegative arthropathies]])
	- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Metabolic/Renal osteodystrophy\|Renal osteodystrophy]]**
	- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Misc/Paget disease\|Paget disease]]** (late phase, structurally weak bone)
- **Local**:
	- **Post-radiation** bone
	- Around prostheses (stress transfer / stress shielding)

---
## Common locations
Classic sites (especially exam fodder):
- **Pelvis & sacrum**
	- Sacral insufficiency fractures (elderly osteoporotic women)
	- Pubic rami
- **Spine**
	- [[Vertebral insufficiency fractures\|Vertebral insufficiency fractures]]
- **Lower limb**
	- **Tibial plateau** (subchondral collapse in osteoporotic knee) 
	- Femoral neck and intertrochanteric region
		- Subtrochanteric region (can overlap with [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Special fracture/Atypical femoral fracture\|bisphosphonate-related stress fractures]])
	- **Foot & ankle**
		- Calcaneus, talus, metatarsals in osteoporotic or neuropathic patients

> [!tip]
> Elderly woman + new **pelvic / low back pain** + **no definite trauma** → think **sacral ± pubic rami insufficiency fracture**.

## Clinical features
- Insidious onset **pain** over affected region
- Often **worsens with weight-bearing**, improves with rest
- Frequently **no recalled fall or accident**
- Can mimic:
	- Metastatic disease (pelvis, sacrum, spine)
	- Osteomyelitis (tender long bone)
	- Degenerative spine disease

## Imaging features

### Radiograph
- Often **normal or very subtle early**
- Later:
	- **Linear sclerosis** or subtle lucent line
	- Mild cortical irregularity or depression (subchondral collapse)
	- Periosteal reaction / callus in long bones
- Examples:
	- **Sacrum**: vertical or oblique fracture lines in sacral ala, increased sclerosis adjacent to SI joints
	- **Pubic rami**: subtle nondisplaced fractures, sclerosis
	- **Tibial plateau**: subchondral radiolucent line with overlying depression or sclerosis
### CT
- Better depiction of:
	- **Cortical breaks** and fracture lines
	- **Subchondral collapse** and articular surface involvement
	- Sclerosis pattern in sacral ala and pubic rami
- Useful to:
	- Confirm occult fractures when XR equivocal
	- Differentiate fracture from lytic metastasis in pelvis/spine (presence of fracture line, lack of aggressive bone destruction)

### MRI
- **Most sensitive** for early insufficiency fractures.
- Typical pattern:
	- **Fracture line**: low signal on **T1** and **T2/STIR**
	- **Surrounding marrow oedema**:  
- Classic examples:
	- **Sacral insufficiency fracture**:
		- Bilateral vertical low-signal lines in sacral ala with surrounding oedema
		- Often sparing midline spinous elements
	- **Subchondral insufficiency fracture of knee/hip**:
		- Curvilinear low-signal subchondral band parallel to articular surface
		- Overlying cartilage may be intact or degenerated

> [!warning]
> Diffuse marrow oedema alone is **not enough** → always look for a **low-signal fracture line** to distinguish insufficiency fracture from isolated marrow oedema or tumour.

### Nuclear medicine (bone scan)
- **Intense focal uptake** at fracture site(s)
- **Sacral insufficiency fractures**:
	- Classic **“Honda sign”** / **H-sign**: bilateral vertical uptake in sacral ala + horizontal component across sacrum.
	- Can be incomplete or absent; absence doesn’t exclude the diagnosis.

## Key differentials by location

### Sacrum / pelvis
- **Metastatic disease**
	- Often more **focal, mass-like**, may involve anterior sacrum or **soft tissue mass**.
- **Insufficiency fracture**
	- Linear pattern, often **bilateral**, associated sclerosis, fracture line, no soft tissue mass.
- **Osteitis condensans ilii**
	- **Triangular sclerosis** on iliac side of SI joint, **no fracture line**, usually younger multiparous women, often asymptomatic or mild pain.
- **Infection**
	- More destructive change, soft tissue collections, systemic signs.

### Spine (vertebral compression)
- **[[Vertebral insufficiency fractures\|Vertebral insufficiency fractures]]**
	- Preserved posterior wall outline
	- Band-like low signal fracture line with surrounding oedema
	- No or minimal paraspinal / epidural soft tissue mass
- **Malignant compression fracture**
	- Involves **posterior elements**, convex posterior border, diffuse replacement of marrow, epidural / paraspinal soft tissue mass.

### Long bones
- **Fatigue fracture** (younger overuse, normal bone)
- **Metastasis / primary bone tumour** ([[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Pathological fracture\|Pathological fracture]])
	- Lytic/destructive lesion, periosteal reaction, soft tissue mass, lack of a simple fracture line pattern.
- **Osteomyelitis**
	- Cortical destruction, sinus tract, sequestrum; clinical/inflammatory markers help.

## Pearls
- **Classic case**: elderly osteoporotic woman with **atraumatic pelvic or low back pain** → sacral ± pubic rami insufficiency fractures.
- **Honda sign**: H-shaped uptake on bone scan = sacral insufficiency fracture.
- **MRI**: low-signal **fracture line** with surrounding marrow oedema is key.
- Many insufficiency fractures (especially hip and vertebral) are also **osteoporotic [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Special fracture/Fragility fracture\|fragility fractures]]** → wording matters in guidelines and exams.
