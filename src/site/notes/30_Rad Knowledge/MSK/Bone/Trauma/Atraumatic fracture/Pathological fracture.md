## Definition
- Fracture through bone weakened by **pre-existing pathology** (usually tumor—primary or metastatic, infection, metabolic disease).
- Occurs with **minimal or no trauma**.
## Common Causes
- **Metastatic disease** (breast, prostate, lung, kidney, thyroid)
- **Primary bone tumors** (e.g., myeloma, lymphoma)
- **Infection** (osteomyelitis)
- **Metabolic bone disease** (e.g., Paget, osteomalacia)
## Imaging Features
- Fracture at site of **bone lesion** (lytic/blastic/mixed)
- Often **ill-defined margins**; possible soft tissue mass
- May have **periosteal reaction** or abnormal marrow signal on MRI
- May see **multiple lesions** if metastatic/myeloma

## Pathological Fracture vs. Fatigue Fracture #VS 

| Feature              | Pathological Fracture                               | Fatigue Fracture                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Location**         | At site of underlying lesion (any bone)             | Predictable stress areas (shaft, metaphysis)       |
| **Bone Quality**     | Abnormal (tumor, infection, etc.)                   | Normal (overuse/repetitive microtrauma)            |
| **Preceding Lesion** | Present (tumor, cyst, infection)                    | Absent                                             |
| **Pattern**          | Often lytic/blastic, destructive, may be comminuted | Usually simple, linear, transverse, no destruction |
| **History**          | Often older/adult, history of malignancy            | Young/athletic, repetitive use                     |
| **Soft Tissue Mass** | May be present                                      | Rare                                               |

## Mirel’s Scoring System 

Radiographic qualitative evaluation for impending pathological fracture risk

| Variable        | 1 point       | 2 points         | 3 points            |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| **Site**        | Upper limb    | Lower limb       | Peritrochanteric    |
| **Pain**        | Mild          | Moderate         | Functional (severe) |
| **Lesion type** | Blastic       | Mixed            | Lytic               |
| **Size**        | <1/3 diameter | 1/3–2/3 diameter | >2/3 diameter       |

- **Total Score:**
    - ≤7: Low risk
    - 8: Borderline
    - ≥9: High risk (consider prophylactic fixation)

## Clinical Pearls #PracitcalPoints 
- **Always** suspect pathological fracture if:
    - Fracture occurs with minimal trauma in abnormal bone
    - Unusual location/pattern (e.g., diaphyseal in elderly)
    - Known malignancy or systemic symptoms
- **Key step:** Look for **underlying lesion** on imaging
- Don’t confuse [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Stress fracture\|fatigue fracture]] (healthy bone, overuse) with pathological fracture (diseased bone, minimal trauma)
