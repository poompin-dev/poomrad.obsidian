## Overview
There are two types of stress fracture:
- **Fatigue fracture**: Repetitive (normal) stress/overused on normal bone
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Insufficiency fracture\|Insufficiency fracture]]**: Repetitive (minimal) stress on weakened bone

Management triage is **risk-based**:
- _Low-risk_: Conservative management
- _High-risk_: May require urgent fixation (risk of non-union/complications)
___
## High risk stress fractures
- **Tensile side** and/or **poor blood supply** (e.g., navicular, anterior tibia)
- Most are fatigue fractures, but **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Special fracture/Atypical femoral fracture\|Atypical femoral fracture]]** is a uniquely high-risk insufficiency fracture

## Imaging approach #PracitcalPoints 
1. Clinical suspicion (pain with activity, overuse history, point tenderness)
2. **X-ray** (first-line)
	- Often normal early
	- Classic findings (if present): linear sclerosis, cortical break, periosteal reaction
3. If X-ray negative, but suspicion remains high:
	1. **MRI** (gold standard)
		- Most sensitive for early detection (marrow edema, before cortical change)
		- Differentiates from tumor, infection, etc.
	2. Bone scan (if MRI not available/contraindicated)
		- Highly sensitive but not specific
	3. Follow up
		- Repeat X-ray in **2-3 weeks** if MRI is not done.
### Pearls
- Image _contralateral_ limb for subtle/uncertain cases (especially navicular, femoral neck).
- **CT**: for surgical planning, occult cortical detail, or if MRI non-diagnostic

## Differential diagnosis #ddx 

| Dx                                           | Classic Patient         | Imaging Features                                                 | Key Clues / Differentiators       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Fatigue fracture**                         | Young athlete, overuse  | Linear sclerosis, periosteal reaction, MRI: low T1, high T2/STIR | Risk site, hx, activity           |
| **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Pathological fracture\|Pathologic fx]]** | Elderly, cancer hx      | Lytic/blastic lesion, abnormal bone                              | Underlying lesion, “no trauma”    |
| **Periostitis**                              | Runners, repetitive use | Periosteal elevation, no fracture line                           | Fusiform thickening, no fx        |
| **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Sclerotic lesions/Osteoid osteoma\|Osteoid osteoma]]**                      | Young, night pain       | Lucent nidus, reactive sclerosis                                 | NSAID relief, classic x-ray       |
| **Osteomyelitis**                            | Sickle cell, diabetics  | Lytic lesion, periosteal reaction, marrow edema                  | Systemic symptoms, infection labs |
## Red flag symptoms #PracitcalPoints 
- Persistent pain at rest or at night (not relieved by rest)
- Pain that increases despite decreased activity/off-loading
- Localized swelling, warmth, or erythema
- New or worsening limp / inability to bear weight
- History of trauma with disproportionate pain
- Failure to improve with conservative management after 2–3 weeks
- Systemic symptoms (fever, malaise) → consider infection or malignancy

If any of these are present, **recommend MRI or specialist referral** to exclude high-risk fracture, [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Pathological fracture\|pathologic fracture]], infection, or malignancy.
