It is a clinical/history-based term describing fractures with **no clearly identifiable discrete or memorable traumatic event**. This distinction helps guide the initial differential diagnosis.

In contrast, a [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Special fracture/Fragility fracture\|Fragility fracture]] – even if caused by a trivial but remembered event (e.g. a fall from standing height) – is considered a **low-energy traumatic fracture**, and the wording matters in both clinical guidelines and examinations.
