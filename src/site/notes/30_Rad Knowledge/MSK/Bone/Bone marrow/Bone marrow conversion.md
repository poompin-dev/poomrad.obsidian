At birth, all bone marrow are predominantly red marrow → conversion from red marrow to yellow marrow occurs shortly after birth and progress throughout life. Adult pattern of bone marrow is typically reached around the age of 25 years.
## Appendicular skeleton
### General patterns
- Peripheral → central (fingers/toes → forearms/legs → arms/thighs)
- Epiphyses → diaphysis → distal metaphysis → proximal metaphysis (this pattern is reversed in [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bone marrow/Red marrow reconversion\|Red marrow reconversion]]).
### Pattern by ages (tubular bones focused)
1. Infancy
	- Primary ossification center (metadiaphysis) is filled with red marrow.
	- Secondary ossification center (epiphyses and apophyses):
		- Un-ossified: cartilage → intermediate T1, high T2.
		- Ossified: yellow marrow within the ossification centers.
2. Childhood
	- Complete marrow conversion of fingers and toes.
	- Yellow marrow replaces in diaphysis.
	- Red marrow remains within the metaphyses.
3. Adolescent
	- Progressive conversion to yellow marrow (distal > proximal)
	- Can see patchy islands of red marrows in distal femora
4. Adult
	- Yellow marrow predominate.
	- Except **proximal metaphyses of the femora and humeri**.

## Axial skeleton
### Spine
#### First decade
- Predominantly red marrow → **lower** SI than adjacent disc on T1WI
- Yellow marrow infiltration can be seen around the basivertebral vein
#### Older than 10 years
- Progressively decrease amount of red marrow → **higher** SI than adjacent disc on T1WI
- 4 patterns of yellow fat marrow conversion
	- Basivertebral vein
	- Peripheral
	- Multiple small regions
	- Multiple large regions
### Pelvis
