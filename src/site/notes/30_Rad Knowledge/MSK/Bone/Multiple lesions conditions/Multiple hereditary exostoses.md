**Genetic disorder**: multiple [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Osteochondroma\|Osteochondroma]]s throughout the skeleton
- **Autosomal dominant** (EXT1/EXT2 genes)`
## Clinical Features
- Presents in **childhood** (often before age 10)
- Progressive, with **increasing number/size of exostoses** until skeletal maturity
- May cause **limb length discrepancy, bowing, joint deformity**
- Often painless, but can compress nerves/vessels, causing impingement
## Common locations
- **Metaphyses** of long bones (femur, tibia, humerus most common)
- Also: pelvis, scapula, ribs
- **Rarely in spine/skull**
## Complications
- **Malignant transformation** (~1–5%) to secondary **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Chondrosarcoma\|Chondrosarcoma]]** arising from its cartilaginous cap
    - Signs: new pain, rapid growth, thick cap
- **Neurovascular impingement**
- **Bursitis** (overlying prominent lesions)
- **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Pathological fracture\|Pathological fracture]]** (rare)
___
## Imaging
- **Multiple bony outgrowths**—continuity of cortex and medullary cavity with parent bone
- **Cartilage cap** (best seen on MRI):
    - Thick cap (>1.5–2 cm in adult) = risk of malignant change
- **Deformity**: bowing, limb shortening, valgus/varus angulation
___
## Pearls
- **New pain or rapid growth in MHE = [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Chondrosarcoma\|Chondrosarcoma]] until proven otherwise**
- Deformities can be severe—refer to ortho early for surveillance
- Family screening is important
