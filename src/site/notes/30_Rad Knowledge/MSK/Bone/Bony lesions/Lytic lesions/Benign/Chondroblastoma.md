The **most common chondroid tumor at the epiphysis**, especially in skeletally immature patients.
## Epidemiology:
- Rare overall, but relatively common among epiphyseal lesions
- Age: 10–25 years
- Male > Female (2–3:1)
## Common Locations
- Epiphysis or apophysis of long bones:
	- Proximal tibia
	- Proximal femur
	- Proximal humerus
	- Distal femur
- Less common: Talus, calcaneus, pelvis
## Histology
- **Chicken-wire calcification**: thin, lace-like calcification around tumor cells
- Polygonal chondroblasts with grooved nuclei
- Multinucleated giant cells may be present
- Immunohistochemistry: S100 positive, DOG1 negative
___
## Radiological Features
### Radiograph / CT
- Eccentric epiphyseal lytic lesion
- Well-defined margin with sclerotic rim
- May show chondroid matrix calcification (stippled or flocculent)
- Possible growth plate disruption or epiphyseal expansion
### MRI
- T1: Low to intermediate signal
- T2: Variable; often low to intermediate due to calcification or cellularity
- Surrounding bone marrow and soft tissue edema is common
- May show fluid-fluid levels if secondary [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Aneurysmal bone cyst\|Aneurysmal bone cyst]] (ABC) present
___
## Differential diagnosis

| Diagnosis                                 | Key Differences                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Giant cell tumor\|Giant cell tumor]]  <br>                | - Older age group (20–40, skeletally mature)<br>- Extends from metaphysis to epiphysis, lacks matrix calcification |
| [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Aneurysmal bone cyst\|ABC]] (secondary) | - Fluid-fluid levels dominant<br>- Younger age<br>- Metaphyseal location more typical                              |
| Clear Cell [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Chondrosarcoma\|Chondrosarcoma]]             | - Older patients, similar location<br>- More aggressive, cortical breakthrough more likely                         |
| Brodie Abscess                            | - Clinical signs of infection<br>- Serpiginous border, sequestrum possible                                         |
| Pediatric Osteomyelitis                   | - Systemic signs<br>- Metaphyseal or epiphyseal lucency, ill-defined margins                                       |
## Management
- Surgical curettage with or without bone grafting
- Local recurrence in 10–15% of cases
- Rare benign pulmonary metastases (histologically benign but spreads)
- Follow-up imaging recommended due to recurrence potential
___
## Exam tips
- Classic exam case: adolescent male with epiphyseal lesion containing chondroid matrix
- Rare but testable sites: talus, pelvis
- Histology buzzword: chicken-wire calcification
- Key differentiators: patient age, lesion location, matrix presence
## Real-Life Practice Considerations
- Age and location are strong diagnostic clues
- Always assess:
	- Epiphyseal involvement and proximity to growth plate
	- Presence of edema or fluid-fluid levels (ABC component)
- If imaging is atypical or lesion is in an unusual location, recommend biopsy
- Mention recurrence risk and rare possibility of pulmonary spread
