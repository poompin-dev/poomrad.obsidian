## Overview
- **High grade malignant** [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Soft tissue tumor/Sarcoma/Small round blue cell tumours\|small round blue cell tumour]] of bone and soft tissue
- Second most common **primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents** (after [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Osteosarcoma\|osteosarcoma]])
- Characterized by **t(11;22)(q24;q12)** → **EWSR1–FLI1** (most common).
- Age: Most commonly affects **children and adolescents**, typically **10–20 years**
- Slight male predominance
- Painful mass is common; may have systemic features (fever, anemia, leukocytosis)
## Common Locations
- **Diaphysis** or **metadiaphysis** of long bones
	- Femur, tibia, humerus
- Also affects **pelvis**, **ribs**, and **flat bones**
- Can originate in **soft tissue** (extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma)
## Imaging Features
**Disproportionately large soft-tissue mass** compared with the amount of cortical destruction
### X-ray / CT
- **Aggressive permeative or moth-eaten lytic lesion**
- **Poorly defined margins**
- Classic **lamellated periosteal reaction** (onion-skin appearance)
- May also see:
	- **Codman's triangle**
	- **Sunburst pattern** (less common)
- Often with **soft tissue mass**
- **No** matrix mineralization
- Bone expansion uncommon
### MRI
- T1: Low to intermediate signal
- T2/STIR: High signal in tumor and soft tissue mass
- Post-contrast: Enhances diffusely
- MRI is essential for local staging:
	- **Intramedullary extent**
	- **Soft tissue involvement**
	- **Neurovascular encasement**

## Differential Diagnosis

| Diagnosis                           | Key Differences                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Osteomyelitis                       | - Abscess/cloaca/sinus tract, sequestrum<br>- Clinical course / response to antibiotics                                 |
| Lymphoma of bone                    | - Older age group<br>- Less florid periosteal reaction<br>- **Large marrow component** with relatively preserved cortex |
| Metastasis (e.g. [[30_Rad Knowledge/Ped/Pediatric neoplasm/Neuroblastoma\|neuroblastoma]]) | - Younger child (often <5 yo), multifocal lesions<br>- History of primary tumor                                         |
| [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Osteosarcoma\|Osteosarcoma]]                    | Osteoid matrix, metaphyseal location, sunburst periosteal reaction                                                      |
| Small-cell osteosarcoma             | Similar histology, but produces osteoid; need biopsy and IHC to distinguish                                             |
## Management
- **Neoadjuvant chemotherapy** → **surgical resection** → **adjuvant chemotherapy ± radiotherapy**
- Multimodal treatment is standard
- Radiotherapy may be used for:
	- Inoperable tumors (e.g. spine, pelvis)
	- Positive margins or poor chemo response
## Prognosis
- 5-year su rvival:
	- **70–80%** for localized disease
	- **<30%** if metastatic at presentation
- Poor prognostic factors:
	- Metastases (especially to lung or bone)
	- Pelvic site → can look **more sclerotic/mixed** and can be bulky at presentation
	- Large tumor volume
	- Poor response to chemotherapy
## Staging Workup
- **MRI of local site**
- **Chest CT** (lung metastasis).
- **Bone scan or FDG-PET/CT** (metastatic survey).
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: may be performed (protocol-dependent), especially if concern for marrow disease.

## Exam Tips
- Classic stem: **10–20y** with **deep bone pain ± fever**, **diaphyseal/metadiaphyseal** long-bone (or **pelvis/rib**) lesion + **large soft-tissue mass**.  
- Radiograph buzz: **permeative/moth-eaten lysis**, **wide zone of transition**, **lamellated (“onion-skin”) periosteal reaction** ± **Codman triangle**; **no osteoid/chondroid matrix**.  
- Path confirm line: **t(11;22)** → **EWSR1–FLI1**; IHC typically **diffuse membranous CD99+** (supportive, not specific).  
- Curveball: **extraskeletal Ewing** = **soft-tissue mass** in a teen with the **same fusion**; treat as Ewing family tumour, not a random sarcoma.
