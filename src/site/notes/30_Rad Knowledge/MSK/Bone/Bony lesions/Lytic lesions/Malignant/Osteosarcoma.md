## Epidemiology
Most common **primary malignant bone tumour** **of childhood/adolescence** (in adults, metastases and [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Multiple myeloma\|myeloma]] are more common overall)
- Age: Bimodal peaks
	- **Primary**: Adolescents (10–20 years)
	- **Secondary**: Older adults with predisposing factors
- Slight male predominance
- Genetic association:
	- Li-Fraumeni
	- RB mutation
## Common Locations
- **Metaphysis of long bones**
	- **Distal femur** > **proximal tibia** > **proximal humerus**
- Secondary osteosarcoma: often axial skeleton (pelvis, spine) or diaphyseal; arises in [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Misc/Paget disease\|Paget disease]], irradiated bone, [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Osteonecrosis/Osteonecrosis\|infarcts]]; usually older adults and worse prognosis.
## Histology
- Malignant spindle cells producing **immature osteoid**
- Several subtypes:
	- **Conventional**
		- Intramedullary, high grade, classic around the knee.
		- Subtypes: osteoblastic, chondroblastic, fibroblastic
	- Telangiectatic
		- purely lytic, expansile, fluid–fluid levels
		- mimics [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Aneurysmal bone cyst\|ABC]] but is **more aggressive, enhances nodular solid, and/or extensive soft tissue components**.
	- Small-cell (resembles [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Ewing sarcoma\|Ewing sarcoma]])
	- **Parosteal**
		- Low-grade, dense ossified mass stuck on posterior distal femur, radiolucent cleavage plane with cortex.
	- **Periosteal**
		- Intermediate grade, **diaphyseal** surface lesion with **chondroid** matrix and perpendicular spicules.

## Imaging Features
Regarding conventional type.
### X-ray / CT
- **Aggressive, mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion**
- **Ill-defined margins**
- **Cloud-like osteoid matrix**
- **Aggressive periosteal reaction**:
	- **Sunburst pattern**
	- **Codman's triangle**
- **Cortical destruction** and **soft tissue mass** common
- **Skip lesions** (intramedullary metastases in same bone) may be seen
### MRI
- T1: Low signal
- T2: high signal tumour/necrosis and fluid, but with low-signal bands/areas corresponding to mineralised osteoid.
- Post-contrast: Heterogeneous enhancement
- Crucial for:
	- **Local staging**
	- **Intraosseous extent**
	- **Neurovascular involvement**
	- **Soft tissue and joint invasion**

## Differential diagnosis

| Diagnosis                    | Key Differences                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Ewing sarcoma\|Ewing sarcoma]]            | Diaphyseal or metadiaphyseal, permeative pattern, large soft-tissue mass, lamellated (“onion-skin”) periosteal reaction, usually **no osteoid matrix**. Systemic symptoms more common.               |
| Osteomyelitis                | Systemic symptoms, **sequestrum, sinus tracts**. However, imaging can be very similar (aggressive periosteal reaction + soft tissue swelling), so clinical picture and marrow signal pattern matter. |
## Management
- Limb-sparing surgery preferred over amputation when possible
	- **Neoadjuvant chemotherapy** → **wide surgical resection** → **adjuvant chemotherapy**
	- Biopsy after imaging; biopsy tract must be placed so it can be completely excised at definitive surgery.
- Prognosis depends on:
	- Response to chemo
	- Presence of metastases (esp. lung)
	- Tumour location and subtype
		- Parosteal/periosteal types have better prognosis
## Staging workup
- Local MRI of affected limb
- Whole bone imaging to evaluate skip lesions
- Chest CT for pulmonary metastases
- Bone scan or PET for metastatic workup
___
## Exam Points
- Most common malignant bone tumour in children/adolescents
- Classic features: **metaphyseal lesion** with **sunburst periosteal reaction** and **osteoid matrix**
- Most common site of metastasis: **lungs**, often with **calcified “cannonball” metastases**.
- Telangiectatic osteosarcoma mimics ABC → always consider in aggressive lesions with fluid levels
