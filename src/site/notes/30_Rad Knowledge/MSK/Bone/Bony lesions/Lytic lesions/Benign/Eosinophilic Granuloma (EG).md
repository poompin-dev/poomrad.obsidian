## Overview
- Localized form of **Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)**
- Clonal proliferation of **Langerhans-type dendritic cells**
- Peak incidence: **5–10 years**
- Male > Female
- Can be **solitary** (common) or **multifocal**
- Non-neoplastic but can be locally aggressive
## Histology
- Langerhans cells with grooved nuclei
- **CD1a**, **Langerin**, **S100** positive
- Electron microscopy: **Birbeck granules** ("tennis racket" structures)
## Systemic Associations
- Solitary EG: typically self-limited
- Multifocal LCH:
    - Hand-Schüller-Christian: skull lesions, diabetes insipidus, exophthalmos
- Disseminated LCH (Letterer-Siwe): poor prognosis

## Imaging Features
### X-ray
Well-defined lytic lesion
- Possible sequestrum or periosteal reaction
#### Classic Radiologic Appearances
- **Vertebra plana**
	- Flattened vertebral body with preservation of posterior elements
	- Most common cause of vertebra plana in children
- **Beveled edge skull lesion**
	- Lytic lesion with asymmetric destruction of inner and outer tables
	- May show soft tissue mass
- Floating tooth
	- Lytic alveolar ridge lesion leading to apparent dental loosening
	- Mandible > maxilla
### MRI
- T1: hypointense
- T2/STIR: hyperintense with marrow and soft tissue edema
- Post-Gd: enhancement often more dramatic than symptoms
### Bone scan
- Increased uptake
- Useful in detecting multifocal lesions

## Diagnostic Tips
- Vertebra plana in child → EG until proven otherwise
- Beveled skull lesion in child = classic
- Floating tooth sign = alveolar EG
- May mimic Brodie abscess or malignancy but lacks systemic signs
- Aggressive MRI appearance can be misleading
