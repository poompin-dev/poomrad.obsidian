## Pathogenesis:
Benign, expansile, blood-filled bone lesion that can be primary or secondary.
- **Primary ABC**: Neoplastic, associated with USP6 gene rearrangement.
- **Secondary ABC**: Cystic, haemorrhagic change developing within a pre-existing bone lesion (e.g. [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Giant cell tumor\|GCT]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Chondroblastoma\|Chondroblastoma]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Sclerotic lesions/Osteoblastoma\|Osteoblastoma]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Fibrous dysplasia\|Fibrous dysplasia]]).
## Epidemiology
- Age: Mostly under 20 years old
- Slight female predominance
## Typical location
- Metaphysis of long bones
  Can extend into the epiphysis in skeletally mature patients (after physeal closure).
	- Proximal tibia
	- Distal femur
- Posterior elements of spine
## Histology
- Blood-filled spaces separated by septa containing fibroblasts, osteoclast-type giant cells and woven bone.
- No malignant cells in primary ABC. If secondary, the underlying lesion may be benign or malignant.
___
## Imaging features
### Radiograph / CT
- Often described as an eccentric, expansile, lytic ‘blow-out’ lesion with a thin shell of cortex.
- Internal septations common
- Periosteal reaction may be present in aggressive cases
### MRI
- Multiloculated lesion with numerous fluid-fluid levels
- T1: Variable depending on blood products; often low to intermediate
- T2: High signal intensity with layering of blood-fluid levels
- Enhancing septa post-contrast
- Marrow and adjacent soft-tissue oedema are common and **not** a red flag by themselves.

Pearl: marrow/soft-tissue oedema on CT/MRI doesn’t automatically mean malignancy in ABC.

## Management
- Surgical curettage with bone grafting
- Selective arterial embolisation or percutaneous sclerotherapy for lesions that are surgically difficult or high-morbidity.
- Recurrence rate: 10–20%, highest recurrence risk after simple curettage in very young children.
___
## Exam tips
- Classic exam clue: expansile metaphyseal lesion in a teenager with multiple fluid-fluid levels on MRI
- Secondary ABC component may appear in other tumors: GCT, chondroblastoma, osteoblastoma
- Fluid-fluid levels are **not pathognomonic** for ABC → Ddx: [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Giant cell tumor\|GCT]], telangiectatic [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Osteosarcoma\|Osteosarcoma]]
- Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is the key **malignant** mimic → tends to be more permeative, with cortical destruction and a soft-tissue mass containing nodular enhancing tissue, not just fluid–fluid levels.
## Real-world pearls
- Always check for solid nodular component or aggressive features to exclude malignancy (secondary ABC arising from primary malignancy)
- Recommend biopsy or further imaging if lesion is atypical, in an unusual location, or in a clearly skeletally mature patient.”
