## Definition  
A **localized collection of neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells** without systemic features of multiple myeloma (e.g., **no CRAB symptoms, marrow involvement, or myeloma-defining biomarkers**).

---
## Subtypes  
### 1. **Solitary Bone Plasmacytoma (SBP)**  
- Most commonly affects axial skeleton (vertebrae, ribs, skull, pelvis).  
- Often presents with **bone pain** or pathological fracture.  
> **Imaging:** lytic lesion without sclerotic margin; MRI shows **T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense** lesion with soft tissue component.  
### 2. **Extramedullary Plasmacytoma (EMP)**  
- Arises in **soft tissue**, especially **head and neck mucosa** (e.g., nasal cavity, oropharynx).  
> **Imaging**: well-defined enhancing soft tissue mass without bone destruction (unless secondarily invaded).

## Rare Variant  
### **Multiple Plasmacytomas Without Myeloma**  
- Very uncommon  
- Can present as multiple bone or soft tissue lesions  
- **Not considered MM** unless any of the following are met:
	- Bone marrow plasma cells <10%  
	- No **CRAB** features  
	-  No **myeloma-defining biomarkers** (e.g., BM clonal cells ≥60%, >1 MRI focal lesion, FLC ratio >100)  
- Often termed **multiple solitary plasmacytomas (MSP)**  
- High risk of progression → requires close follow-up
___
## Diagnosis  
- **Clonal plasma cells** confirmed by biopsy  
- Bone marrow: <10% clonal plasma cells  
- Absence of **CRAB** or **MM-defining event** 
- **Whole-body MRI** or **PET/CT** for staging (to exclude systemic disease)

---
## Management  
- **Radiotherapy** is mainstay (high radiosensitivity)  
- Surgery only for diagnostic biopsy or mechanical stabilization  
- Systemic therapy only if progression to MM

---
## Prognosis  
- ~50–60% progress to MM within 10 years  
	- Risk higher in SBP than EMP  
- Lifelong follow-up: **SPEP**, **FLC**, and imaging

## Key Imaging Clues
| Subtype | Modality     | Key Findings                                                             |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SBP     | X-ray / MRI  | Solitary lytic lesion, soft tissue mass, no sclerosis                    |
| EMP     | CT / MRI     | Enhancing mucosal mass, well defined, often in upper aerodigestive tract |
| MSP     | PET/CT / MRI | Multifocal lesions, but no marrow or systemic signs of MM                |
