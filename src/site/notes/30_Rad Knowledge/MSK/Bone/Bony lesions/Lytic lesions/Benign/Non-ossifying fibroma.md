## Overview
- Most common benign bone lesion in children and adolescents
- Considered a **developmental cortical defect** rather than a true neoplasm
- Belongs to the **fibrous cortical defect spectrum**
- Often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally
## Epidemiology
- Age: Predominantly seen between ages **5–20**
- Gender: Slight **male predominance**
- Clinically silent unless complicated by a [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Pathological fracture\|pathological fracture]]
## Location
- Typically involves the **metaphysis** of long bones
- Most frequent sites:
	- **Distal femur**
	- **Proximal tibia**
- May extend toward the **diaphysis** with bone growth
- Same anatomic sites as some malignant lesions (e.g., [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Osteosarcoma\|Osteosarcoma]]) but very different clinical and radiologic behavior
___
## Radiographic Features
### X-ray/CT:
- Well-defined, **eccentric**, **lucent lesion** with a **thin sclerotic rim**
- **No periosteal reaction** unless complicated by fracture
- **No matrix calcification**
- **Cortical thinning** may be present
- Lesion may migrate diaphyseally as the patient grows
- Size classification:
	- **< 2 cm**: Often termed *fibrous cortical defect*
	- **> 2 cm (up to ~7 cm)**: Classic non-ossifying fibroma
### MRI Features
- T1: **Hypointense** relative to marrow
- T2/STIR: **Hyperintense or heterogeneous**, reflecting fibrous content
- **No significant enhancement** unless there's associated healing, hemorrhage, or remodeling
- May show **fluid-like signal**, especially in larger or healing lesions

## Differential Diagnosis

| Diagnosis             | Key Differences                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Fibrous dysplasia\|Fibrous dysplasia]] | Ground-glass matrix, may involve diaphysis, no sclerotic rim         |
| [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Chondroblastoma\|Chondroblastoma]]   | Epiphyseal, younger patients, matrix calcification possible          |
| [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Sclerotic lesions/Osteoid osteoma\|Osteoid osteoma]]   | Smaller, intensely painful, central nidus with surrounding sclerosis |
| Healing Bone Lesion   | Clinical history and temporal progression essential                  |
## Clinical Management
- **No treatment required** in most cases
- Lesion typically **resolves spontaneously** with skeletal maturity
- **Follow-up imaging** may be advised if:
	- Lesion is large (>50% cortical involvement)
	- Patient presents with pain or fracture risk
- **Surgical curettage** or stabilization is rarely indicated, reserved for:
	- **Pathologic fracture**
	- Lesion size causing structural compromise
