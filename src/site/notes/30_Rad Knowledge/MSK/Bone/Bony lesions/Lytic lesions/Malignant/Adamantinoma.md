## Overview
- Rare low-grade malignant primary bone tumor with epithelial differentiation
- Almost exclusively in tibia (85–90%), classic anterior cortical/diaphyseal location
- Exists on a spectrum with osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD):
	- OFD → benign, pediatric, cortical
	- OFD-like adamantinoma → intermediate
	- Classic adamantinoma → malignant, more intramedullary/soft-tissue extension
- Key pathologic feature: biphasic – epithelial nests (CK+) in osteofibrous stroma
- Slow-growing, locally aggressive, low but real metastatic potential (lungs, late)
## Epidemiology
- Age: most common 20–40 years (second–third decade); smaller older peak
- Slight male predominance
- <1% of primary bone malignancies
- Rare extratibial sites: fibula, ulna, femur, radius (similar imaging pattern)

## Key radiological manifestations

### Radiographs / CT (First-Line)
- Eccentric, elongated, multilobulated lytic lesion in anterior tibial cortex/diaphysis
- Classic “soap-bubble” or multilocular appearance with thin septa
- Geographic, often sclerotic margins
- Cortical expansion and thinning
- Anterior bowing of tibia common
- Satellite/multifocal cortical lesions (“string of beads”)
- Periosteal reaction variable (laminated or solid)
- Soft-tissue mass rare but indicates aggression
- CT: excellent for cortical detail, satellite foci, subtle breakthrough
### MRI (Essential for Staging)
- T1WI: low to intermediate signal (muscle-like)
- T2WI/STIR: heterogeneous high signal
- Post-contrast: avid heterogeneous enhancement (epithelial component)
- Critical for:
	- Intramedullary extension (more in classic than OFD-like)
	- Soft-tissue mass
	- Satellite lesions
	- Neurovascular involvement (surgical planning)
- No intralesional fat (helps vs fibrous dysplasia)
### Nuclear Medicine
- Tc-99m MDP: moderate–intense uptake
- FDG-PET: variable, generally low-grade avidity

## Differential Diagnosis

| Diagnosis                  | Key Differentiators                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD) | Younger (<10 y), purely cortical, minimal intramedullary, CK-negative |
| Fibrous dysplasia          | Medullary-based, ground-glass matrix, any bone           |
| Ewing sarcoma              | More aggressive, permeative, onion-skin periostitis, systemic symptoms |
| Chronic osteomyelitis      | Sequestrum, sinus tracts, clinical infection history     |
| Aneurysmal bone cyst       | Expansile, fluid–fluid levels, metaphyseal               |
| Metastatic carcinoma       | Older patients, known primary                            |

## Imaging Approach
- Start with AP/lateral radiographs of entire tibia
- CT for cortical/satellite detail if radiographs suggestive
- MRI whole tibia (knee to ankle) with contrast:
	- Assess marrow, soft tissue, satellites
	- Distinguish classic from OFD-like (more extension in classic)
- Chest CT for staging (late pulmonary mets)

## Management & Follow-Up (Imaging Implications)
- En bloc resection or wide excision preferred (curettage → high recurrence)
- Chemotherapy/radiotherapy ineffective
- Long-term imaging follow-up essential:
	- Local recurrence common (years–decades later)
	- Late pulmonary metastases
## Pearls
- Anterior tibial diaphysis + soap-bubble lytic + satellite lesions → adamantinoma until proven otherwise
- Spectrum awareness critical: monitor pediatric anterior tibial OFD lesions for progression
- Classic > OFD-like in intramedullary and soft-tissue involvement
- Imaging cannot reliably separate OFD-like from classic → biopsy mandatory (CK status)
- Report should flag need for IHC correlation in appropriate clinical/imaging context
- Exam buzzwords: “eccentric lucent lesion anterior tibial cortex”, “soap-bubble”, “cytokeratin-positive bone tumor”
