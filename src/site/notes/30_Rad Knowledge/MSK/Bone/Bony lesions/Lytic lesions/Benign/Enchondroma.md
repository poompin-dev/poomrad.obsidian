## Overview
- **Benign intramedullary cartilage tumor**
- Overwhelmingly occur in the **appendicular skeleton**, especially **small tubular bones** (hands/feet)., but can also occur in long bones (e.g. femur, humerus)
- Typically found **incidentally** in adults, or after pathologic fracture
## Epidemiology
- Most common benign bone tumor of the hand
- Age: 10–40 years
- No sex predilection
## Pathophysiology
- Arises from **residual cartilage rests** in the medullary cavity
- Composed of **hyaline cartilage**
- May show calcification and endosteal scalloping over time
## Clinical Features
- Usually **asymptomatic**
- May present with **pain** if associated with fracture or malignant transformation
___
## Imaging Features
### X-ray
- **Well-defined, lytic lesion** with **chondroid matrix calcification** ("rings and arcs")
- May cause **endosteal scalloping**, especially if >50% of cortical thickness
- **No periosteal reaction** or soft tissue mass
### CT
- Better delineates **matrix calcification**
- Confirms absence of cortical breakthrough or soft tissue extension
### MRI
- **T1**: Low to intermediate signal
- **T2**: High signal (due to cartilage)
- May see **internal septations**, lobulation
- Evaluate for features suggesting malignancy
___
## Differential Diagnosis

| Diagnosis                        | Key Features                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Low-grade [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Chondrosarcoma\|Chondrosarcoma]]** | Pain without fracture, cortical destruction, soft tissue mass, periosteal reaction         |
| **Fibrous dysplasia**            | "Ground-glass" matrix, expansion with cortical thinning, often monostotic                  |
| **Chondromyxoid fibroma**        | Eccentric location, scalloped margins, metaphyseal, lobulated, rare and locally aggressive |
## Management
- **Observation** if asymptomatic and stable
- **Curettage ± bone grafting** if symptomatic, growing, or concerning for malignancy
- Refer to ortho-oncology if suspicious for chondrosarcoma
___
## Red Flags for Malignant Transformation
- Pain without fracture
- Cortical breach or soft tissue extension
- Large size (>5 cm in long bone)
- Endosteal scalloping >2/3 cortical thickness
- Interval growth on serial imaging
## Pearls
- In hands/feet: almost always benign → pain usually from fracture, not malignancy
- In long bones: more caution needed
- Lesions in axial skeleton (pelvis, ribs): low-grade chondrosarcoma until proven otherwise
