## Clinical
- most common manifesting symptoms are:
	- Fatigue (often from normocytic normochromic anemia due to marrow infiltration)
	- Bone pain (due to intraosseous proliferation of abnormal plasma cells and possible fracture)
- major cause of death = infection and renal failure
## Laboratory
- Most patients with multiple myeloma have abnormal serum proteins
- **Rouleaux formation** on peripheral blood smear
- **Bence-Jones proteins** are found in approximately 50% of cases
- Elevated ESR common due to high protein burden
- 3% of patients will not have abnormal proteins in **both** their serum or urine, a condition termed "**nonsecretory myeloma**"
## Diagnostic criteria
Either of
- bone marrow analysis shows ≥10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells
- biopsy-proven bone/soft tissue [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Plasmacytoma\|Plasmacytoma]]
plus
- myeloma defining event
	- end-organ damage (CRAB)
		  - **C**: hypercalcemia
		  - **R**: renal insufficiency
		  - **A**: anemia
		  - **B**: bone lesions (seen on PF, CT, PET/CT)
	- malignancy biomarker (i.e., you can diagnose active myeloma even **without CRAB**)
		- clonal cell concentration >60%
		- **FLC ratio ≥100 or ≤0.01** **+** clonal plasma cells ≥10%
		- At least one focal lesion ≥5 mm on MRI, involving bone or bone marrow.

## Imaging
- osteolytic lesions are readily seen in radiographic skeletal survey in 80% of cases.
- however, radiographic skeletal survey is insensitive to early marrow disease, hence MRI or PET/CT is preferred for early detection.
- extra-medullary disease is present in 1-2% at the time of presentation
	- 8% throughout the disease course
