## Overview
- **Benign, fluid-filled medullary bone lesion**
- Usually **monostotic** and **centrally located**
- Often discovered incidentally or after **pathologic fracture**
## Epidemiology
- Age: **5–20 years** (rare in adults)
- Male > Female (2–3:1)
- Common sites: **proximal humerus** and **proximal femur** (metaphysis)
## Pathophysiology
- Etiology unclear — theories include venous obstruction or fluid accumulation
- Lined by fibrous membrane, filled with serous fluid
- Often migrates from metaphysis toward diaphysis with skeletal growth
## Clinical Features
- Often **asymptomatic**
- May present with **mild pain** or **pathologic fracture**
___
## Imaging Features
### X-ray
- **Centrally located**, **well-defined, lytic lesion** in metaphysis
- **No matrix calcification**
- **Thin sclerotic margin**
- Cortex may be thinned but usually intact unless fractured
- May cause **pathologic fracture**, classically with:  
    → **Fallen fragment sign** = cortical bone fragment lying dependently within cyst
### CT
- Confirms fluid density and thin cortex
- Helps exclude internal matrix or septations (which may suggest other entities)
### MRI
- **T1**: Low signal
- **T2**: High signal (fluid)
- No solid enhancement; mild rim enhancement possible
___
## Differential Diagnosis

| Diagnosis                     | Distinguishing Features                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Aneurysmal bone cyst\|Aneurysmal bone cyst]]**  | Expansile, eccentric, fluid-fluid levels, septations             |
| **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Fibrous dysplasia\|Fibrous dysplasia]]**     | "Ground-glass" matrix, expansion, no fluid, common in ribs/femur |
| **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Non-ossifying fibroma\|Non-ossifying fibroma]]** | Eccentric, multiloculated, metaphyseal, sclerotic rim            |
| **Eosinophilic Granuloma**    | Often painful, aggressive-appearing lysis in younger children    |

## Management #ddx 
- **Observation** if asymptomatic and non-fractured (may resolve with skeletal maturity)
- **Steroid injection** (methylprednisolone) or bone marrow injection
- **Curettage and bone grafting** if recurrent or symptomatic
- Surgical fixation if associated with fracture
___
## Pearls
- **Fallen fragment sign** is pathognomonic if present
- Tends to resolve after skeletal maturity
- Proximal humerus is most common site
