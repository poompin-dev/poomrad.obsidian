## Overview
- Most common **benign bone tumor**
- Composed of **bony outgrowth ([[70_Glossary/MSK/Exostosis\|Exostosis]])** covered by **cartilage cap**
- Always has **continuity of cortex and medullary cavity** with the parent bone
- Occurs at the **metaphysis**, **grows away from the joint**
- Can be **solitary** or part of **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Multiple lesions conditions/Multiple hereditary exostoses\|Multiple hereditary exostoses]] (MHE)**
## Epidemiology
- Age: Typically arises in **childhood/adolescence**
- Stops growing after **skeletal maturity**
- Male > Female
- Multiple lesions → think **MHE (autosomal dominant)**
## Common Locations
- **Metaphysis** of long bones, especially around the knee:
	- Distal femur
	- Proximal tibia
- Also seen in:
	- Humerus, scapula, pelvis
	- Rare in small bones
## Complications
- **Neurovascular impingement** (esp. near popliteal artery)
- **Fracture** at stalk (pedunculated)
- **Bursitis** overlying the lesion
- **Malignant transformation** (to secondary [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Chondrosarcoma\|Chondrosarcoma]]):
	 - Rare (<1% in solitary lesions, ~5% in MHE)
  - Suspect if:
	   - New pain/swelling in adult
	   - Cap thickness **>2 cm**
	   - Cortical irregularity or soft tissue mass

## Imaging Features
### X-ray / CT
- **Exophytic lesion** projecting away from nearby joint
- Continuous **cortex and medullary canal** with parent bone
- **Sessile** or **pedunculated** base
- Cartilage cap often **not visible** on radiograph
- **No aggressive features** (unless malignant transformation)
### MRI
- Best for evaluating:
  - **Cartilage cap thickness**
  - **Neurovascular impingement**
  - **Bursa formation or fracture**
- Cartilage cap: **T2 bright**
  - Adults: **<1.5–2 cm** = benign
  - **>2 cm** → suspicious for secondary chondrosarcoma

## Differential diagnosis

All of these lack **cortex and medullary continuity** with the parent bone.

| Diagnosis                                                 | Key Differences                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parosteal osteosarcoma                                    | Attached to cortex but no medullary continuity; often metaphyseal                                                     |
| Osteoma                                                   | Dense, ivory-like, craniofacial bones only                                                                            |
| Periosteal chondroma                                      | Juxtacortical, but scallops cortex and lacks medullary continuity                                                     |
| Nora’s lesion (BPOP)                                      | Exophytic but no medullary continuity, more irregular and recurrent                                                   |
| **Trevor disease**<br>(Dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica) | - Epiphyseal osteochondroma-like cartilage tumor<br>- Growing from epiphysis **toward** the joint; usually ankle/knee |
## Management
- **No treatment** needed if asymptomatic and benign-appearing
- **Surgical excision** if:
	- Painful
	- Causing mechanical symptoms or neurovascular compression
	- Suspicious for malignant transformation
- **Lifelong monitoring** in MHE due to transformation risk

## Exam tips
- Buzzword: **"Cortex and medullary continuity"**
- Cartilage cap >2 cm = red flag in adults
- Most common benign tumor; often incidental finding
- Know difference between **pedunculated** (height > base) and **sessile** (flat base) types
- MHE = multiple, bilateral, symmetrical lesions
