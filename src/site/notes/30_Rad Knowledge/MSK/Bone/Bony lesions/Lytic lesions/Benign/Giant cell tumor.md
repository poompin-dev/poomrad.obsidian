## Overview
- Intermediate (locally aggressive) tumour in WHO classification
- Composed of **mononuclear stromal cells** and **multinucleated giant cells** (functionally resemble osteoclast)
- Rarely metastasises (lung mets in ~2–5% despite benign histology)
## Epidemiology
- Age: **20–40 years** (skeletally mature) but older age can also be seen (may be due to late presentation?)
- Slight female predominance
- Accounts for ~5% of primary bone tumours (relatively common)
## Common Locations
- **Epiphysis** or **metaphyseal-epiphyseal** junction of long bones
	- Very rare before physeal closure - in an open physis, an [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Insight/Epiphyseal bone lesions\|epiphyseal lesion]] is [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Chondroblastoma\|Chondroblastoma]] until proven otherwise.
- Most common sites:
	- **Knee**: distal femur > proximal tibia
	- **Distal radius** (tends to recur more, functionally more aggressive)
	- **Sacrum** (axial variant): often difficult or impossible to resect en bloc
## Clinical Features
- Local pain and swelling
- Limited joint mobility (due to juxta-articular location)
- Possible [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Pathological fracture\|Pathological fracture]]
- Rare lung metastases (despite benign histology)
## Histology
- Numerous **uniformly distributed multinucleated giant cells**
- Background of **mononuclear stromal cells** (neoplastic component)
- Most conventional giant cell tumours harbour an H3F3A mutation (G34W), which helps distinguish them from other giant-cell–rich lesions.
- May show areas of haemorrhage, necrosis, or cystic change

## Imaging Features
### Radiograph
- **Eccentric, expansile, lytic lesion**
- Can extend to **subchondral bone** (epiphyseal involvement is classic)
- **Non-sclerotic margin**, narrow zone of transition ([[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Insight/Modified Lodwick-Madewell Classification\|modified Lodwick 1B]])
- Periosteal reaction is usually **absent** unless there is a [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Pathological fracture\|Pathological fracture]].
- **No** matrix mineralization
- Soft tissue mass suggests more aggressive or recurrent disease.
### MRI
- T1: Iso to hypointense
- T2: Variable (often heterogeneous hyperSI)
	- Peripheral low-signal rim may reflect sclerosis/hemosiderin
- May show **fluid-fluid levels** (especially if secondary ABC)
- Enhancing solid components and internal septations
- Useful for assessing soft tissue extension
### CT
- More detailed evaluation of cortical destruction and internal trabeculae
- Helpful for surgical planning

## Differential Diagnosis
Practically, well-defined non-sclerotic rim osteolytic lesion with "3E" features (epiphyseal involvement, eccentric, expansile) without matrix mineralization in skeletally mature patient is very suggestive of giant cell tumor.

But nevertheless, let's provide some possible differential for completeness.

## Management
### Resectable
- **Extended curettage** ± adjuvant (e.g., phenol, cryotherapy) with cement or bone graft
- **Wide excision** for recurrent or aggressive lesions
### Unresectable
- **Radiotherapy**: used cautiously because of risk of secondary sarcoma.
- **Denosumab** (RANKL inhibitor): used for unresectable/sacral lesions or as neoadjuvant. It induces peripheral sclerosis and can obscure the true tumour margin on imaging and at surgery.
## Prognosis
- High local recurrence rate after curettage
- Good with adequate local control (wide resection with R0 margin - at the cost of function)
- Lung metastases are rare, often indolent; some may remain stable or even regress spontaneously.

## Practical pearls
- **Absence of matrix calcification** and **non-sclerotic margin** are key clues.
- May show **fluid-fluid levels** — but don't call it [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Aneurysmal bone cyst\|ABC]] or telangiectatic [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Osteosarcoma\|Osteosarcoma]] purely on that.
- Always distinguish from **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Chondroblastoma\|Chondroblastoma]]** (younger age, skeletally immature) and **brown tumour** (check hyperparathyroid labs).
- If it’s epiphyseal, skeletally mature, non-sclerotic, no matrix, ‘3E’ (epiphyseal, eccentric, expansile) → **giant cell tumour until proven otherwise**.
