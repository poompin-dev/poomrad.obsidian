> [!summary]
> Self-limiting inflammatory bone disorder of infancy causing painful soft tissue swelling and subperiosteal new bone formation, classically involving the mandible.

## Basics
- Typical age:
	- Onset: infancy, usually <6 months
	- Rarely congenital / in utero (more likely to associated with genetic mutation)
- Genetics:
	- Sporadic or autosomal dominant
	- Often associated with **COL1A1** mutation in familial / severe forms (osteogenesis imperfecta spectrum)

## Clinical
- Irritable, crying infant
- Painful soft tissue swelling over affected bones
- Low-grade fever common, but may be afebrile
- Decreased limb movement if long bones involved
- Mandibular involvement → feeding difficulty, drooling, facial swelling
- Systemically:
	- May have raised inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP), mild leucocytosis
	- Usually not septic-toxic (unlike osteomyelitis)

> [!warning] Clinical trap
> Can be mislabelled as **osteomyelitis** or **non-accidental injury**, leading to unnecessary IV antibiotics, extensive septic workup, or even social/legal issues.

## Imaging

### Distribution
  - Mandible (classic site)
  - Clavicles
  - Ribs
	  - May be combined with pleural effusion.
  - Diaphyses of long bones (upper > lower limbs)
	  - Usually asymmetric and involving ulna
  Epiphyses typically spared.

### Radiographic features
- Subperiosteal new bone formation with:
	- Cortical thickening / hyperostosis
	- Diaphyseal predominant, often multifocal and relatively symmetric
- Adjacent soft tissue swelling
- No aggressive bone destruction or lytic lesion pattern
- Changes evolve over weeks–months, then remodel

### Other modalities
- **US:** soft tissue thickening, periosteal elevation, increased vascularity
- **MRI/CT:** rarely required; confirm subperiosteal new bone and exclude other pathology

> [!tip] Radiologist job
> - Recognise the pattern (age + mandibular/diaphyseal hyperostosis).
> - Use the word **“compatible with infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease)”**.
> - Explicitly comment that imaging **does not suggest osteomyelitis or non-accidental injury** if that is a concern.

## Differential diagnosis
- **Osteomyelitis**
	- Often metaphyseal, more focal, systemic sepsis more marked
	- May show lytic lesions, abscess, sequestrum
- **Non-accidental injury**
	- Fractures in various stages of healing, metaphyseal corner fractures, inconsistent history
	- Distribution and pattern usually not simply diaphyseal hyperostosis
- **Scurvy** (older infants/children, dietary history)
- **Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy** (wrong age group)
- Bone tumours / leukaemia → lytic lesions, marrow changes, systemic features

## Course and prognosis
- Self-limiting:
	- Symptoms peak over weeks, resolve over months
	- Bone changes remodel; mild cortical thickening may persist radiographically
- Long-term:
	- Normal growth and function expected in most cases
	- Rare deformity if very severe or untreated congenital cases

## Management
- Mainly **supportive**:
	- Analgesia (paracetamol/NSAIDs)
	- Short course steroids in severe or refractory cases (specialist decision)
- Exclude serious differentials (osteomyelitis, abuse) clinically + imaging
- Consider genetics / metabolic workup if:
	- Very early onset (in utero)
	- Recurrent episodes
	- Strong family history
	- Features overlapping with connective tissue disease / OI spectrum

> [!important] Key exam points
> - Infant <6 months, painful swelling + irritability + mandibular / diaphyseal hyperostosis.
> - Radiograph: subperiosteal new bone, diaphyseal, multifocal, no aggressive lysis.
> - Diagnosis is clinical + radiologic; disease is **benign and self-limiting**.
> - Recognising the pattern avoids unnecessary biopsy, prolonged antibiotics, and abuse accusations.
