> [!summary]
> Symmetrical, diaphyseal periosteal new bone formation with clubbing and arthralgia, **almost always secondary to thoracic disease** (classically lung carcinoma).

---
## Overview
- **Form of secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy** related to **intrathoracic pathology**  
	- “[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Sclerotic lesions/Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy\|Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy]]” (HOA) = clinical–radiologic syndrome  
	- “Hypertrophic *pulmonary* osteoarthropathy” (HPOA) = HOA specifically due to thoracic disease
- Characterised by:
	- **Symmetrical periosteal new bone** along long bones
	- **Digital clubbing**
	- **Arthralgia / joint symptoms**
- Classically a **paraneoplastic phenomenon** in adults (lung carcinoma), but also seen with chronic non-neoplastic chest disease and some abdominal/cardio­vascular conditions.

---
## Pathophysiology
- Not fully understood; likely **humoral + vascular**:
	- Intrathoracic disease → abnormal shunting of **megakaryocytes/platelets** → peripheral fragmentation → release of **growth factors (e.g. VEGF, PDGF)**  
	- Leads to:
	    - Increased **periosteal blood flow**
	    - **Osteoblastic periosteal new bone** and soft tissue oedema
- Neurogenic reflex mechanisms from the vagus and intercostal nerves also proposed.

---
## Clinical Features
- **Classic triad:**
	1. **Periostitis** – symmetrical, painful swelling along diaphyses of long bones  
	2. **Digital clubbing** – fingers and toes (may precede bone changes)  
	3. **Arthralgia / arthritis** – joint pain, stiffness, sometimes effusions
- Symptoms:
	- Dull, aching **bone pain**, worse with weight-bearing
	- **Swollen, tender limbs**
	- Decreased range of motion due to periarticular involvement
- Clubbing present in **most but not all**; absence of clubbing does **not completely exclude** early HPOA.

## Aetiology

> [!tip]
> In an adult with new HPOA, **primary lung malignancy** is the default “exam-safe” underlying cause unless stated otherwise.

| Cause                                                   | Notes                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary lung carcinoma**                              | Most common in adults; especially bronchogenic carcinoma    |
| Metastatic lung disease                                 | Metastases to pleura/lung; usually with bulky/thick disease |
| Chronic suppurative lung disease                        | Lung abscess, empyema                                       |
| Bronchiectasis / cystic fibrosis                        | Long-standing, severe disease                               |
| Congenital cyanotic heart disease                       | Important cause in **children/adolescents**                 |
| Abdominal tumours (less common)                         | Hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, others             |
| Other chronic intrathoracic (extra-pulmonary) pathology | E.g. mesothelioma, chronic pleural effusion                 |

## Imaging
### X-ray
- **Distribution:**
	- **Bilateral, symmetrical periosteal reaction**
	- Mainly **diaphyses ± metaphyses** of long bones:
	    - Distal **radius, ulna**
	    - **Tibia, fibula, femur**
	- **Epiphyses typically spared** (nice exam phrase)
- **Periosteal reaction pattern:**
	- Usually **laminated (“onion-skin”)** or **solid**; can become more irregular with chronicity
	- May be seen as **multiple parallel periosteal layers** running along the shaft
- Associated findings:
	- Adjacent soft tissue swelling
	- Early disease may be **subtle or radiographically normal** → bone scan more sensitive

### Bone scan
- Very sensitive; may be positive when radiographs are still normal
- **Findings:**
	- **Diffuse, symmetrical increased cortical uptake** along long bones  
	- Described as:
	    - **“[[70_Glossary/MSK/Double stripe sign\|Double stripe sign]]”** / “**tramline sign**” – parallel linear cortical uptake along both sides of the shaft
- Uptake may also be seen in small tubular bones of hands and feet.

### CT / MRI
- **Rarely needed for diagnosis**; more often used for **searching the primary intrathoracic cause** (CT chest).
- When performed over the limbs:
	- CT: thickened periosteum with new bone along the cortex
	- MRI: low-signal periosteal new bone with adjacent soft tissue oedema; may enhance after contrast

## Differential Diagnosis #ddx

> Differential for **bilateral diaphyseal periosteal reaction of long bones**.

| Condition                                                   | Distribution                          | Periosteal Reaction     | Key Features / Clues                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Secondary HPOA (HPOA)**                                  | Bilateral, symmetric long bones       | Lamellated / solid      | Adult; intrathoracic disease; clubbing common                         |
| **Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy** (pachydermoperiostosis) | Similar to HPOA, often more diffuse | Lamellated / irregular  | Young males; **coarse facial features**, skin thickening, hyperhidrosis; no underlying chest disease |
| **Thyroid acropachy**                                      | Hands/feet, usually symmetrical       | Irregular, shaggy       | Graves’ disease; exophthalmos, pretibial myxoedema; marked soft tissue swelling |
| **Chronic venous insufficiency**                           | Distal lower limbs, often asymmetric  | Solid / irregular       | Venous stasis, oedema, varicosities, ulcers; no clubbing              |
| **Drug-induced (e.g. prostaglandin E therapy)**            | Symmetrical long bones (infants/children) | Lamellated           | Paediatric; on long-term PGE infusion (e.g. duct-dependent CHD)       |
| **Hypervitaminosis A**                                     | Long bones                            | Irregular / lamellated  | Vitamin A excess (retinoid therapy); systemic symptoms (irritability, alopecia, hepatomegaly) |

## Management
- **Always search for and treat the underlying cause**:
	- CT chest (and further workup) looking for **lung malignancy or chronic thoracic disease**
	- Treat infection, drain empyema, manage heart/abdominal pathology, etc.
- **Symptomatic management**:
	- Analgesia (NSAIDs etc.)
	- Physiotherapy, activity modification
- Radiologic + clinical changes often **regress** if the primary pathology is effectively treated; clubbing may be **slow to regress or persist**.

---
## Key Exam Pearls
- **Think lung cancer**:  
  New **bilateral symmetric diaphyseal periosteal reaction** in an adult → **HPOA from primary lung carcinoma** until proven otherwise.
- **Pattern**:
	- **Distal, symmetrical periosteal new bone formation**
	- **Diaphyseal ± metaphyseal**, **spares epiphyses**
- **Clinical association**:
	- **Digital clubbing + arthralgia + periostitis** = hypertrophic osteoarthropathy pattern.
- **Bone scan**:
	- Cortical, symmetric uptake in long bones with the **“[[70_Glossary/MSK/Double stripe sign\|Double stripe sign]]”** is classic.
- Exam trick: if they say “**hypertrophic osteoarthropathy**” with a lung lesion → you can safely call it **hypertrophic *pulmonary* osteoarthropathy (HPOA)**.
