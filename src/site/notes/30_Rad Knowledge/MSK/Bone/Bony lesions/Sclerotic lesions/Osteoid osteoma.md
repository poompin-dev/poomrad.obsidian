## Overview
- **Benign osteoblastic tumor** characterized by a **small nidus (<1.5 cm)** of osteoid and woven bone
- Classic triad: **nocturnal pain**, **NSAID-responsive**, **radiolucent nidus**
- Self-limiting over time; can resolve spontaneously
## Epidemiology
- Age: Mostly **adolescents and young adults** (10–30 years)
- Male > Female (~2–3:1)
- ~10–12% of all benign bone tumors
## Clinical Features
- **Nocturnal pain**, **dramatically relieved by NSAIDs**
- Localized tenderness
- In **intra-articular lesions**:
	- Pain may mimic **arthritis**
	- Less sclerosis, more synovitis
- In **spinal lesions**:
	- May cause **painful scoliosis** (convexity pointed away from the lesion: pain side = growth side)
	- Lumbar > cervical > thoracic
## Common Locations

| Type                                | Sites                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Cortical** (classic)              | Diaphysis of long bones (femur > tibia)  |
| **Medullary**                       | Small bones (hands/feet)                 |
| **Subperiosteal / Intra-articular** | Femoral neck, spine (posterior elements) |
## Histology
- Central **nidus of osteoid and woven bone**
- Surrounded by **vascular stroma**
- Peripheral reactive bone formation

## Imaging Features
### X-ray
- Small **radiolucent nidus (<1.5 cm)** with variable central mineralization
- Surrounded by **dense reactive sclerosis** (especially in cortical lesions)
- May be **occult on plain films**, particularly in intra-articular or spine locations
### CT
- **Modality of choice**
- Clearly shows:
	- Central **nidus**
	- Possible central calcification
	- Reactive **cortical thickening**
### MRI
- Variable appearance
- **T1**: Low signal nidus
- **T2**: Hyperintense nidus, surrounding marrow and soft tissue **edema**
- May be misinterpreted as infection or stress fracture
### Bone Scan
- **Double-density sign**: intense focal uptake in nidus with surrounding less intense zone
- Useful for localizing **clinically occult lesions**

## Differential Diagnosis

| Diagnosis                     | Key Differences                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Sclerotic lesions/Osteoblastoma\|Osteoblastoma]]**         | Nidus >1.5–2 cm, less sclerotic reaction, not NSAID-responsive |
| **Brodie abscess**            | Serpiginous border, clinical infection signs, sequestrum       |
| **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Trauma/Atraumatic fracture/Stress fracture\|Stress fracture]]**       | Linear lucency, periosteal reaction, history of activity       |
| **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Ewing sarcoma\|Ewing sarcoma]]**         | Aggressive, soft tissue mass, systemic symptoms                |
| **Intra-articular pathology** | Synovitis or arthritis on MRI may obscure nidus                |
## Management
- **NSAIDs**: Symptomatic relief, often sufficient; lesions may burn out over years
- **CT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA)**: Minimally invasive, curative in most cases
- **Surgical excision**: Rarely needed now unless RFA fails or not feasible
## Prognosis
- Excellent
- Rare recurrence after RFA
- Symptoms resolve rapidly post-treatment

## FRCR / Thai Board Exam Tips
- Buzzwords:
	- **“Young male + night pain + relieved by NSAIDs”**
	- **“Lucent nidus with surrounding sclerosis”**
- Intra-articular and spinal variants may lack classic features → high clinical suspicion needed
- Nidus <1.5 cm = osteoid osteoma  
  Nidus >2 cm = think **osteoblastoma**
## Real-Life Reporting Tips
- Look for **tiny nidus** on CT if pain and MRI suggest inflammation but no mass
- Describe:
	- Location (cortical, medullary, subperiosteal)
	- Nidus size
	- Central mineralization
	- Surrounding sclerosis or edema
- Suggest **RFA** referral if diagnosis is confident and lesion is symptomatic
