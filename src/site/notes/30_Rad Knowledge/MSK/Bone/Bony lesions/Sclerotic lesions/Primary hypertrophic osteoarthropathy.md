## Demographic
Rare disease of unknown cause that demonstrates an autosomal dominant genetic transmission, with marked variability of expression.
- Predominates and is more severe in Blacks.
## Clinical
- Early insidious onset of
	- Enlargement of the hands and feet → a pawlike appearance
	- Clubbing of the distal ends of the fingers and toes
	- Convexity of the nails
	- Coarsening of the skin of the face and scalp (pachyderma)
	- Ptosis
	- Furrowing of the cutaneous tissue
	- Enlargement with disruption of the normal contour of the extremities
	- Vague pains in the bones and joints
- Progresses for 10-20 years before arresting spontaneously.
- Absence of significant joint pain

## Imaging - Radiograph

- Widespread and symmetric osseous thickening due to periosteal proliferation, most pronounced in the tubular bones of the extremities
	- Spine involvement is unusual
- Effect diaphyses and metaphyses (like [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Sclerotic lesions/Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy\|Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy]])
- Extends into the epiphyseal region, producing shaggy, ill-defined, bony excrescences.

## Differential diagnosis
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Sclerotic lesions/Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy\|Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy]]
	- Later onset
	- Usually without family history
	- Significant joint pain (absence in pachydermoperiostosis)
- [[Thyroid acropachy\|Thyroid acropachy]]
	- Fluffy, spiculated periosteal bone is encountered in the hands and feet but is rarely observed elsewhere.
