## Overview
- Rare, benign bone tumor of osteoblastic origin
- Histologically similar to [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Sclerotic lesions/Osteoid osteoma\|osteoid osteoma]], but **larger** and can be more aggressive
- Most common in **adolescents and young adults**
## Key Features
- **Size:** >2 cm (osteoid osteoma <2 cm)
- **Location:** 
	- Cortical based lesion
	- Prefers 
		- **Posterior elements of spine** (esp. lumbar)
		- Long bones of lower extremities (femur, tibia)
- **Pain:** Dull, less nocturnal, **less NSAID-responsive** than osteoid osteoma
___
## Imaging
**General**
- Expansile, lytic lesion; may have central nidus and surrounding sclerosis
- Can have **cortical breach**, **soft tissue extension**, and **aggressive appearance**
**X-ray:** 
- Lytic, expansile, sometimes with thin sclerotic rim; may see matrix mineralization
**CT:** 
- Defines nidus, bony expansion, internal calcifications
**MRI:** 
- Disproportionately extensive marrow and soft tissue edema, extending well beyond actual tumor margin (not soft tissue extension like in osteosarcoma or osteomyelitis)
**Bone scan:** 
- Intense uptake (hot lesion)
