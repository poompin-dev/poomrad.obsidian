Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is a clinical syndrome consisting (can be incomplete) of
- Clubbing of the digits of the hands and feet
- Enlargement of the extremities secondary to periarticular and osseous proliferation
- Painful and swollen joints. 
Additional features include
- Thickening of skin on the face and scalp (pachyderma)

The syndrome can be divided into two categories:

- [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Sclerotic lesions/Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy\|secondary]]

Radionuclide bone imaging is a highly sensitive modality for detecting lesions.
