## Concepts (update from previous edition)
Integrates static margin + dynamic changes + “invisible”/occult category so temporal evolution and radiographically occult disease matter.

## Classification Table 
Use this only to categorise lesion margin/aggressiveness. Patient age and lesion location (and clinical, duh) are still KINGS for differential diagnosis.

| Type   | Description                                                                                 | Possible entities                                                   | Classic lesions                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1A** | Well-defined, geographic, **sclerotic rim**                                                 | Almost always benign lesions                                        | [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Non-ossifying fibroma\|NOF]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Simple Bone Cyst\|SBC]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Enchondroma\|Enchondroma]] |
| **1B** | Well-defined, geographic, sharp margin, **no sclerotic rim**                                | Usually benign but can be locally aggresive                         | [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Giant cell tumor\|GCT]], [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Benign/Chondroblastoma\|Chondroblastoma]]                             |
| **2**  | Geographic, **ill-defined margin** (partial/circumferential)                                | Worrisome for low-grade malignancy or active infection/inflammation | LCH, Low-grade [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Chondrosarcoma\|Chondrosarcoma]]                                          |
| **3A** | Any lesion that shows **newly ill-defined margins** or **progressive endosteal scalloping** | Dynamic process, increasing aggression                              | Secondary chondrosarcoma arising from enchondroma                          |
| **3B** | **Moth-eaten/permeative**                                                                   | Highly aggressive: [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Soft tissue/Soft tissue tumor/Sarcoma/Small round blue cell tumours\|Small round blue cell tumours]], infection               | [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Bony lesions/Lytic lesions/Malignant/Ewing sarcoma\|Ewing sarcoma]], Lymphoma, Osteosarcoma, Osteomyelitis                   |

## Practical pearls
- ≤2 = Geographic borders that
	- 1 = well-defined
		- 1A = with sclerotic rim
		- 2A = without sclerotic rim
	- 2 = ill-defined
- Key changes from [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Bone/Insight/Lodwick classification (original)\|original]] → modified:
	- IC → 2 (geographic, ill-defined)
	- II, III → 3B (moth-eaten/permeative)
	- add 3A, 3C (new concepts)
- Always **compare with old images**—look for margin change or endosteal scalloping.
	- **Change over time (3A):** Key red flag for malignancy, even if original margin was geographic.
- **3C (occult):** Remember that radiograph-negative does NOT mean benign → Flag for possible marrow infiltrative disease (e.g., myeloma, metastasis).
