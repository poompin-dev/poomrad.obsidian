## Overview
- **Diaphysis = shaft of long bone, less "special" than epiphysis but still a useful clue**
- Most bone tumors can occur here, but some have a **predilection for diaphysis**
- Metaphyseal lesions can grow into the diaphysis in skeletally immature patients (open physis)
- Location alone rarely diagnostic—use age, margin, matrix, and periosteal reaction

## Pearls
- **Diaphysis = classic for Ewing, adamantinoma, lymphoma, fibrous dysplasia, osteoid osteoma**
- **Multiple myeloma** can involve any part but likes shafts in long bones
- **Metaphyseal lesions can extend into diaphysis**, esp. in growing bones
- Matrix, periosteal rxn, soft tissue component help differentiate

> Diaphysis is a "strong clue" for a few entities, **but most lesions cross boundaries**. Always correlate clinically and radiologically.
