Grading growth/aggressiveness of _lytic_ lesions on radiograph according to border pattern.

- **I** - geographic border
	- **IA** - geographic, _well-defined_, with **sclerotic rim**
	- **IB** - geographic, _well-defined_, **no** sclerotic rim
	- **IC** - geographic, **ill-defined** margin (transition zone)
