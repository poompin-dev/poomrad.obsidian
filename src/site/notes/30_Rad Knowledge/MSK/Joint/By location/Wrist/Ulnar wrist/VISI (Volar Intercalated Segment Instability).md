## Definition
- A carpal instability pattern where the **lunate tilts volarly (flexes)**, decreasing the **scapholunate angle < 30°**.
- Represents failure of normal coordination between the lunate and triquetrum.
## Clinical Significance
- May be incidental finding in ligamentously lax individuals
- If symptomatic: ulnar-sided wrist pain, decreased grip strength
- Consider provocative testing or wrist arthroscopy for confirmation
## Mechanism
- **Lunotriquetral ligament disruption** → triquetrum extends, lunate follows scaphoid into flexion
## Causes
- **Lunotriquetral ligament injury** (trauma)
- **Congenital ligamentous laxity** (normal variant in some)
- Rarely associated with **rheumatoid arthritis**
## Frequency and Relevance
- **Much less common than DISI**
- **Often seen in asymptomatic individuals** with hyperlaxity → can be a **normal variant**
- Clinical correlation is essential before labeling it pathologic
___
## Imaging Findings
- **Lunate tilted volarly** on lateral wrist view
	- **Scapholunate angle < 30°** (normal = 30–60°)
- No widening of SL interval
- Evaluate for signs of instability or degenerative changes
___
## Management
- **Asymptomatic** or hyperlaxity-related: No treatment needed
- **Symptomatic or traumatic**: Splinting, physiotherapy, possible surgical repair
