> [!summary]  
> **Focal compressive neuropathy** of the **axillary nerve** (± posterior circumflex humeral artery) within the **quadrilateral space**, classically in overhead/throwing athletes, causing posterior shoulder pain and teres minor-predominant denervation.

---
## Key anatomy

### **Quadrilateral space boundaries**    
- Superior: **teres minor**
- Inferior: **teres major**
- Medial: **long head of triceps**
- Lateral: **surgical neck of humerus**
### **Contents**
- **Axillary nerve**
- **Posterior circumflex humeral artery (PCHA)**

---
## Pathogenesis

- Chronic **compression/entrapment** of axillary nerve (± PCHA) at quadrilateral space, due to:
    - Overhead/throwing sports (repetitive abduction + external rotation)
    - Fibrous bands / scarring
    - Paralabral cysts from posterosuperior labral tears
    - Callus, exostosis, space-occupying lesion

- Neurogenic ± vascular component (PCHA compression → positional ischaemia/aneurysm).

---
## Clinical features

### Demographic
- Young or middle-aged **overhead athletes** (throwers, swimmers, volleyball, weightlifters)
### Symptoms
- Dull, aching **posterior shoulder** pain
- Worse with **abduction + external rotation**
- Often exercise-induced; may describe loss of throwing power/endurance
### Signs
- Weakness of shoulder abduction/external rotation (often subtle)
- Atrophy of **teres minor** (± deltoid)
- Sensory change over **“regimental badge”** area (axillary nerve territory) – variable
- ± Vascular findings if PCHA involved:
	- Positional loss of radial pulse
	- Arm fatigue, coolness, rarely distal emboli

## Imaging

### Radiograph
- Often **normal**
- Look for:
    - Post-traumatic deformity, exostosis
    - Degenerative change, enthesophytes, prior surgery
### MRI
- **Core finding**
    - **Isolated or dominant teres minor denervation**:
        - **Acute/subacute**: T2/STIR hyperintense, swollen teres minor
        - **Chronic**: T1 hyperintense fatty replacement ± volume loss
- **Possible additional findings**
    - Deltoid involvement if more proximal axillary nerve involvement
    - Underlying cause:
        - **Paralabral cyst** in posterosuperior quadrant
        - Scar tissue / mass along quadrilateral space
- Must **exclude other causes** of teres minor atrophy:
    - Prior surgery, trauma
    - Massive rotator cuff tear (posterior cuff dysfunction)
    - Brachial neuritis ([[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Joint/By location/Shoulder/Parsonage–Turner syndrome\|Parsonage–Turner syndrome]])
    - Iatrogenic nerve injury
### Vascular imaging
- **CTA / MRA / DSA** (with arm neutral vs abducted/external rotated):
    - Positional **narrowing/occlusion** of PCHA
    - ± Aneurysm / irregularity of PCHA
- Important in vascular-type QSS or suspected distal embolic phenomena.
### Ultrasound
- Can show:
    - Teres minor atrophy (echogenic, thinned)
    - Dilated or aneurysmal PCHA
    - Dynamic compression with provocative positioning
- Operator dependent; often adjunct to MRI/CTA.

## Neurophysiology
NCS/EMG:
- **Axillary neuropathy** localised to quadrilateral space
- Abnormalities most marked in **teres minor** (and sometimes deltoid)
- Rest of brachial plexus normal → helps distinguish from plexopathy (e.g. Parsonage–Turner).

---
## Differentials (for isolated teres minor atrophy)
- Quadrilateral space syndrome (axillary nerve entrapment)
- Post-traumatic / post-surgical axillary nerve injury
- Massive rotator cuff tear with posterior cuff dysfunction
- **Parsonage–Turner syndrome** (brachial neuritis) – usually **multifocal** pattern, dramatic acute pain story
- Idiopathic muscular atrophy

> [!info] Quick contrast with Parsonage–Turner syndrome
> 
> - **QSS**: athlete, chronic positional posterior shoulder pain, **isolated teres minor** ± deltoid denervation, discrete entrapment site.
>     
> - **PTS**: sudden, severe shoulder/arm pain → later patchy weakness, **multifocal muscle involvement** across several nerves/plexus segments, no single compression point.

## Management
**Conservative first line**
- Activity modification (reduce overhead load)
- Physiotherapy for scapulohumeral mechanics + rotator cuff strengthening
- Analgesia
**Interventions (case-dependent)**
- Target underlying lesion (e.g. paralabral cyst decompression)
- Surgical decompression/release of quadrilateral space in refractory cases
## Radiology reporting tips
Describe:
- Pattern of muscle denervation (which muscles, acute vs chronic)
- Evidence of focal axillary nerve compromise
- Any mass / cyst / structural cause
Suggest:
- Correlation with clinical exam + EMG
- Consideration of vascular imaging if symptoms suggest ischaemia or emboli.
