> [!summary]
> **Parsonage–Turner syndrome (PTS)** = **acute brachial neuritis / neuralgic amyotrophy**.  
> Sudden severe shoulder/upper arm pain → days–weeks later **patchy weakness + muscle atrophy**, due to immune-mediated brachial plexus / peripheral nerve inflammation. MRI: multifocal denervation; not a single focal entrapment.

## Terminology
- **Parsonage–Turner syndrome (PTS)**
- **Neuralgic amyotrophy**
- **Acute brachial neuritis**

---
## Pathogenesis
- Thought to be **immune-mediated** inflammation of:
  - Brachial plexus trunks/divisions
  - Individual peripheral nerves (e.g. suprascapular, long thoracic, axillary)
- Often follows a **trigger** (not always present):
  - Viral or systemic infection
  - Vaccination
  - Surgery / anaesthesia
  - Pregnancy/post-partum period
- Results in **axonal neuropathy** with denervation of affected muscles.

---
## Epidemiology
- Typically **young to middle-aged adults**
- Slight male predominance reported in many series
- Up to one-third have bilateral or recurrent episodes over time.

---
## Clinical features

> [!summary] Classic story
> Previously well adult → **sudden, brutal shoulder/upper arm pain** (often nocturnal, unilateral) → pain gradually settles over days–weeks → **weakness and visible wasting** in a **patchy, non-dermatomal** distribution.
### Pain phase
- **Acute onset**, often at night
- Severe, deep, burning or stabbing pain in:
  - Shoulder
  - Proximal arm
  - Periscapular region
- Pain lasts days to weeks, then **improves spontaneously**.
### Weakness / atrophy phase
- Appears as pain settles
- Weakness depends on **which nerves/branches** are involved:
- Muscle wasting becomes visible over weeks–months.
- Sensory loss: often **mild and patchy**, not purely dermatomal.

> [!info] Key clinical contrast to entrapment
> - PTS: **dramatic pain first**, then weakness; pattern is **multifocal**, not a single nerve root or tunnel.  
> - Entrapment: usually chronic, load-related pain with progressive symptoms in one nerve/space.

---
## Common patterns of involvement

- **Upper trunk / suprascapular nerve predominant**
  - Supra/infraspinatus denervation → weak abduction/external rotation 
- **Long thoracic nerve palsy**
  - Scapular winging (medial border prominence)
- **Axillary nerve involvement**
  - Deltoid ± teres minor denervation
- Often **multiple nerves together**, giving a “crazy” pattern that does not respect simple root or peripheral nerve maps.

## Imaging

### MRI shoulder / brachial plexus

> [!summary] MRI hallmark
> **Multifocal denervation** in a distribution that crosses a single peripheral nerve or a single muscle tendon lesion, often involving several shoulder girdle muscles.

#### Muscle changes
- **Acute–subacute**
  - T2/STIR: **hyperintense oedema** in involved muscles
  - Mild enlargement/bulkiness
- **Chronic**
  - T1: fatty replacement, volume loss (atrophy)
- Pattern:
  - Often involves multiple muscles:
    - e.g. supra + infraspinatus ± deltoid ± serratus anterior
  - Not explained by:
    - A single tendon tear
    - A single focal nerve entrapment alone
#### Plexus / nerve changes (MR neurography)
- Thickening and **T2 hyperintensity** of:
  - Brachial plexus segments
  - Individual branches (e.g. suprascapular nerve)
- No discrete compressive mass or bony bottleneck.
### Radiograph / CT
- Usually **normal**, or only background degenerative change
- Important mainly to **exclude** other structural causes of shoulder pain (fracture, large cuff tear, mass).

---
## Electrophysiology (EMG/NCS)
- Confirms **axonal neuropathy** of affected nerves:
	- Reduced recruitment
	- Fibrillation potentials
- Distribution is **patchy**:
	- Multiple nerves and/or plexus segments
	- Helps differentiate from single-nerve entrapment or pure root radiculopathy.

---
## Differentials

> [!warning] Don’t miss these
> - **C5–C6 cervical radiculopathy**
> - **Rotator cuff tear**  
> - **[[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Joint/By location/Shoulder/Quadrilateral space syndrome\|Quadrilateral space syndrome]]**  
> - Motor neurone disease / other neuropathies  
> - Myopathies (e.g. inflammatory myositis)

---
## Management

> [!info] Role of imaging
> Radiology mainly:  
> 1) **Support** diagnosis (demonstrate denervation pattern + exclude structural causes)  
> 2) Help distinguish from surgically correctable pathologies (disc, entrapment, massive cuff tear).

- **Acute phase**
	- Strong analgesia (NSAIDs, neuropathic pain agents, sometimes opioids)
	- Some clinicians use corticosteroids early; evidence is mixed.
- **Rehabilitation**
	- Physiotherapy:
		- Maintain range of motion
		- Prevent capsular contracture/frozen shoulder
		- Gradual strengthening of recovering muscles
- **Prognosis**
	- Recovery over **months to years**
		- Many patients regain good function, but:
		- Residual weakness
		- Endurance loss
	- Persistent scapular dyskinesis are not uncommon.
