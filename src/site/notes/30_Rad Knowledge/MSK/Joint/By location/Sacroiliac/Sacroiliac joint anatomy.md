## Structural composition
There are 2 histologically different portions in each side of the SI joint.
### Synovial portion (anteroinferior)
- [[30_Rad Knowledge/MSK/Joint/Inflammatory joint diseases/Seronegative Spondyloarthropathy/Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)\|Axial spondyloarthopathy]] usually involve synovial portion first especially at **inferior** portion at **iliac** side (possibly due to thicker hyaline cartilage on iliac side)
### Ligamentous portion (posterosuperior)
- More often affected by mechanical/degenerative change (e.g., osteoarthritis)
